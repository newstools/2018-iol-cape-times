CAPE TOWN - Woolworths is in the process of recalling its frozen savoury rice mix product, the company said on Tuesday. The rice mix has sweetcorn that was apparently imported from the Greenyard factory, that may have been the source of a Listeria outbreak in Hungary. Woolworths said that recall was a precaution after a global recall was issued by the Hungarian Food Safety Agency. The food company said in a statement that food safety is of critical importance to Woolworths and that they take all issues regarding the production of their food extremely seriously. The company went on to say that the Listeria bacteria is easily destroyed by cooking. The Frozen Savoury Rice Mix product is uncooked and frozen and so requires cooking before consumption. Thorough cooking ensures that the product is safe. "We are voluntarily recalling this product as a precautionary measure, on the global instruction of the Hungarian Food Safety Agency." Woolworths has also said that none of its other frozen sweetcorn or vegetable products were affected. "Woolworths and our suppliers proactively manage and prevent microbial contamination of food and have done so for many years. We have very strict protocols in place as part of our standard food safety management process." "To verify the safety of our food products, we implement additional monitoring where we independently have our food products tested randomly.Â  This testing includes Listeria. This product has been tested and found to be compliant." Customers should note that if they have purchased the product, they should return it to their local store for a full refund.
