He was killed collecting scrap metal from bins in an industrial area on Friday. Jacobs and his sister Heloise Jacobs, 24, were in the industrial area of Krone Street, Worcester, when he is reported to have become embroiled in an altercation with a person identified as a business owner. Her son was shot twice and died at the scene. Roodeval resident Dina Adams, 49, said: “My son was no threat to this man. My daughter said he showed up and started threatening them, hitting my son. “When Johannes picked up a rock, this man pulled his gun and my son froze. He shot him in front of my daughter,” she said. She said Jacobs was unemployed and a father of two children aged 6 and 4. “I have not slept since this thing happened. It’s an unbearable pain that I cannot describe other than comparing it to a piece of my body being torn from me. I will go to court and face this man. “I want to tell the magistrate he must stay behind bars because he is a danger to our community,” she said. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said: “This office can confirm that a 27-year-old man was shot and killed in Worcester on Friday morning during an apparent altercation between two men. The suspect, a 44-year-old man was arrested immediately after the incident. He is due to make a court appearance in Worcester tomorrow (Monday).” Ward councillor Colin Wilskut said they were mobilising residents to support Adams in court on Monday.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za  Cape Times
