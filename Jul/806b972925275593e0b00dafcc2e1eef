CAPE TOWN - Woolworths announced that they will be recalling their frozen savoury rice mix product due to Listeria concerns.     We’re recalling our frozen savoury rice as a precautionary measure; if you’ve bought the product please return it to store for a full refund. More info: https://t.co/He1iGKogZK — Woolworths SA (@WOOLWORTHS_SA) July 11, 2018  The rice mix has sweetcorn that was apparently imported from the Greenyard factory, that may have been the source of a Listeria outbreak in Hungary. Woolworths said that recall was a precaution after a global recall was issued by the Hungarian Food Safety Agency. The food company said in a statement that food safety is of critical importance to Woolworths and that they take all issues regarding the production of their food extremely seriously. On Twitter, consumers have shown outrage with the #Woolworths.

So far, since the Listeria outbreak hit SA over 200 people including 80 babies have died. The outbreak was linked to Enterprise facilities in Polokwane and Germiston which produced cold meats, including Woolworths’ beloved Salami sticks. Business Report has reached out to Woolworths for comment and they said that they were warned on the 9th of July by their producer in Belgium about the recall notice. "We were notified by our producer in Belgium on Monday evening, 9 July, of the Hungarian recall notice for all their products", said Woolworths. When asked what they would do to ensure that this would not happen again, Woolworths said that food safety is of great importance to them. "Food safety is of critical importance to Woolworths and we take all issues regarding the production of our food extremely seriously. We work with our suppliers proactively manage and prevent microbial contamination of food and have done so for many years.
