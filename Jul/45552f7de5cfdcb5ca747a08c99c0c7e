Johannesburg - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed that it will not prosecute suspended Sars commissioner Tom Moyane for the alleged assault of his son's 17-year-old partner. Moyane faced assault charges after he was accused of "ninja-kicking" and "rugby tackling" the teen, who is also the mother of his grandson at his home in May. According to Sunday Times, Moyane "ninja-kicked" the teenager, screamed at her and accused her of witchcraft during an argument at his home in Weltevreden Park. Medical reports reportedly showed that the girl suffered a bruised abdomen, bruised jaw and a cut to the inside of her jaw. Moyane was expected to appear in court on June 1. The NPA however, on Thursday confirmed to IOL that it has declined to prosecute the tax boss over the alleged assault. "We can confirm this... because there's no prospect of a successful prosecution," NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said. She was unable to confirm if Moyane or the complainant had been informed of the NPA's decision. Moyane's lawyer Eric Mabuza, speaking to News24, welcomed the decision, saying it would allow his client to focus on his upcoming disciplinary hearing. IOL
