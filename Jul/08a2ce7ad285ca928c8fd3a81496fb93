Cape Town - With dam levels at an average of 47.2%, Capetonians will be happy to hear that there is another cold front on the way, promising more rain. The cold front is expected to pass through the province by Thursday, TimesLive reported. Victoria Nurse‚ forecaster at the South African Weather Service‚ didn't expect temperatures to drop too markedly. The possibility of more rain will bring further relief to the province‚ with dam levels almost double the 24% for the same time last year. Local Government  Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said: “Only weeks ago‚ Clanwilliam Dam was below 10%. Now the dam‚ one of the biggest in the province‚ is full. The sluices were opened over the past weekend. It’s an incredible turnaround.” Bredell warned‚ however, that although “a lot of rain has helped replenish groundwater, we need to allow the system to recover as much as possible ahead of the summer season". “In addition‚ some areas remain stressed, particularly the Karoo region‚ where the rainfall has not provided adequate relief yet. This drought we have tackled will not be the last drought we will see. "Long-term behavioural change‚ better resource management and a growing resilience to these shocks are going to be vital moving forward.” Cape Times
