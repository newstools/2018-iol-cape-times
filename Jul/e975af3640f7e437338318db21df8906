The Rawsonville community in Worcester can breathe a sigh of relief following the rearrest of convicted rapist Isak “Seun” Lemanie, who escaped. His prison attire was reportedly found behind a nearby school after escaping on Sunday. Correctional Services provincial commissioner Delekile Klaas said the escapee was arrested on Tuesday. “He was working in the agricultural area on Sunday when he escaped while there was a warder on duty. “His prison attire was found at a nearby school and the department is currently conducting an internal investigation looking into the conduct of the warder.” Rawsonville Community Policing Forum chairperson Harold Andrew said residents panicked following reports of the escape. “We are just grateful he is back where he belongs, as I have a young daughter myself and this (left) me sleepless.” He said that he would meet with the station commander today to get more clarity on how this person could have escaped.
