The man at the centre of the violent protests in the Zwelihle community in Hermanus, Gcobani Ndzongana, is an officer at the Department of Correctional Services, the Strand Magistrate's Court heard on Friday. On the same day, Police Minister Bheki Cele had to beat a hasty retreat out of Hermanus in the midst of the ongoing protests after discussions with community leaders, but his spokesperson said he would return to further engage with the community again on Tuesday, News24 reported. Siyabulela Nothwala told Police Minister Bheki Cele during an emergency side meeting that people say all of the problems are rooted in unequal service delivery between black and white residents of Hermanus. The "discarded" community felt they needed to address this. Due to Ndzongana being a correctional officer he needed to be placed in a single cell at Pollsmoor Prison for his own safety, said his lawyer, Thulasiziwe Twala. Police spokesperson Colonel Luthando Nosilela confirmed that Ndzongana was a prison warden at Pollsmoor. Ndzongana's arrest for incitement and destruction of property last week Tuesday was the catalyst for the ongoing violent protests in the Zwelihle community in Hermanus. "Gcobani is an officer, he works for Correctional Services so his life will be in danger," said Ndzongana's lawyer. "I requested that he either be kept at the police station or that we get a commitment from his colleagues from correctional services ... that he will be kept safe." Ndzongana will appear in court for his bail application on July 27.
