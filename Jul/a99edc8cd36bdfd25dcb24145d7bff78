Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said an investigation, which started “blindly”, was thoroughly investigated and successfully brought the per­petrator to book. “The thorough investigation of crime and the bringing of perpetrators before court is crucial in efforts of the SAPS to ensure convictions. “This occurred again on Tuesday, when Moegamat Farouk Oliver, a member of the Hard Livings gang, was sentenced in the Khayelitsha Priority Court to 25 years’ effective imprisonment,” Van Wyk said. He said police members had attended to the murder scene on the corner of Red River and Renoster roads, Manenberg, where they found the body of the victim with multiple gunshot wounds to his upper body on September 9, last year. He said the murder was committed in the heart of the community, where it was difficult to get any witnesses or gather evidence. “It was a case of starting an investigation blindly. The serious violent crimes unit canvassed the area, piecing together evidence and eventually making an arrest. The victim, a member of the American gang, was shot metres away from his home and succumbed to injuries he sustained during the shooting,” Van Wyk said. Oliver was sentenced on various charges, including 25 years for murder, 10 years for the illegal possession of a firearm, two years for the illegal possession of ammunition, 12 years for being an accessory, five years for his affiliation to a gang and five years imprisonment for being actively involved in a gang. The sentences will run concurrently. Acting provincial commissioner Major-General Burger said the successful investigation was the culmination of hard and dedicated teamwork.
