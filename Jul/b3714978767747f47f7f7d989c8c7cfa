JOHANNESBURG - A 28-year-old alleged rapist died in custody after he was arrested in connection with the rape of a 69-year-old woman in Uniondale, Western Cape police said on Tuesday. Captain Dumile Gwavu said on Monday night Bongani Qubu allegedly kicked down the door of a woman, threatened her with a knife and raped her at Tuis Street Zone 9 Thembalethu. â€œQubu fell asleep on the bed after the [alleged] rape and the woman called for help from the community, who assaulted him. He was rescued by the police from the community and got medical treatment from an ambulance," said Gwavu. Gwavu said Qubu was detained for rape at the Thembalethu police station where he later died. A case of murder was being investigated by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). "The community is urged not to take the law into their own hands and anyone who acts against the law will face the law," said Gwavu. African New Agency (ANA)
