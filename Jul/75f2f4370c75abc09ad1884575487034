The 34-year-old, a resident of Kleinbos Avenue, is expected to appear at the Strand Magistrate’s Court today on charges of illegal possession of explosives and ammunition. He was arrested on Saturday night. This followed the police’s search of his VW Golf. “Our efforts to ensure the safety of the community are often strengthened by the public, who provide us with valuable information, as proven by the arrest of a suspect who was found in possession of dynamite,” said police spokesperson Andre Traut. Asked whether the explosives were intended to be used for cash in transit- related crimes, Traut said: “The circumstances are under investigation and it is too soon to speculate.” The breakthrough came a day after police recovered three hijacked vehicles in Kraaifontein hours apart on Thursday. Traut said police were on patrol when they spotted a VW Polo under suspicious circumstances. An investigation found that the vehicle had been hijacked in Kleinvlei a few days earlier. The driver, a 23-year-old suspect was arrested. On Friday another Kraaifontein patrol came across two suspects, a 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old woman, who were trying to start a VW Golf, but the anti-hijacking device prevented them from doing so.
