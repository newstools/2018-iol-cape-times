Capetonians should start making contingency plans with load shedding expected to take place sometime this week. At 4pm on Monday afternoon, Eskom said in an update customers throughout the country "are advised to plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place". The power utility had earlier warned of a constrained national power supply – "caused by protests and intimidation" – for the first time since late last month. "(Customers) are encouraged to check their load shedding schedules on the Eskom and their municipal website." It did not divulge when it expected the rotational power outages to be implemented. The country experienced several days of load shedding in mid-June. Eskom blamed the power outages on acts of intimidation and sabotage by workers locked in wage negotiations. However, unions denied they were involved. The wage negotiations have still not ended. "The national grid is expected to be constrained this evening due to instability at several power stations due to acts of intimidation. Several power stations (are) now running at skeletal staff, a move that could compromise our ability to ensure security of power supply," Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said in a tweet on Monday afternoon. According to Phasiwe, "the power utility was also investigating why certain units had gone offline". "A handful of power generating units, including two at Matla, one at Koeberg and Arnot, are currently offline. Investigations are continuing to determine the cause of these outages. A conveyor belt was cut at Matla power station in what management believes is an act of sabotage."
