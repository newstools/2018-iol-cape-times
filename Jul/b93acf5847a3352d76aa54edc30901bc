Johannesburg - Duduzane Zuma's culpable homicide case has been postponed to August 23, following a short appearance at the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday morning. He was released on a warning and did not have to apply for bail. Zuma arrived at court with his legal team, and a few of his family members were on hand for moral support. He was summoned to appear in court on Thursday morning to face two charges of culpable homicide related to a 2014 accident that resulted in the death of Phumzile Dube.    Dube died instantly after Zuma’s Porsche crashed into a minibus taxi on M1 in Johannesburg. Another woman, who was also in the taxi at the time, died weeks later in hospital, even though her death was later ruled as the result of natural causes. Magistrate Heidi Bernard granted the postponement on Thursday to allow for the disclosure of inquest proceedings and the contents of his docket. In his defence, Zuma has previously maintained that he was not negligent as his car had lost control as it had driven into a puddle that resulted in it swerving and hitting the taxi. An inquest ruled on by Magistrate Lalitha Chetty found that Zuma was negligent and that his actions led to Dube's death. However, the NPA had declined to prosecute Zuma in 2015, claiming the low chances of the case succeeding in court. Earlier this year the case re-emerged after former NPA prosecutor Gerrie Nel and Afriforum threatened to privately prosecute Zuma. The group said Dube’s family never received justice. The family was present at the media briefing held by Afriforum which announced the intention to privately prosecute Zuma. This was Zuma’s second appearance in court this week. On Monday, he was released on R100 000 bail and he is facing charges of corruption for the attempted bribery of former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. Political Bureau
