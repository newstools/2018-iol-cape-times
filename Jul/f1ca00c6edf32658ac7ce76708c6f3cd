This emerged after Johan Williams, 47, appeared in the Wellington Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for the murder of 21-year-old Chantell Matthyssen. The family said Williams, who was a close friend of theirs, had enticed their daughter with the promise of a job opportunity. Matthyssen’s body was found on Monday after she had been reported missing by her family. The case was postponed to July 13 to allow Williams to appoint his own lawyer. Matthyssen’s mother, Carol Petersen, who could not attend court proceedings on Wednesday, said her daughter would be cremated and her funeral held at the weekend. “We were not able to attend the court proceedings, but we have received updates about the postponement. "For now we are concentrating on the funeral of my daughter,” she said. Petersen said she shared the news with Matthyssen’s son after identifying her body. “So far he is okay. We are sure there will be many questions when he realises what happened to his mother, but for now we as a family are there to support him and each other through this,” Petersen said. Cape Times
