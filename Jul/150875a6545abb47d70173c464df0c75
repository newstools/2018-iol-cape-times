Tomorrow's event at the Coline Williams and Robbie Waterwitch Statues Memorial Site, opposite the Athlone Magistrate’s Court, is hosted by the ANC’s provincial constituency office in Athlone, in conjunction with its six cluster branches. It comes during the month marking the 31st year of Struggle icon Ashley Kriel’s death, who was shot and killed at the age of 20 on July 9, 1987, when apartheid police tracked him to a house in Hazendal, Athlone. The regional chairperson of the uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association’s Dullah Omar Region, Fumanekile Booi, said the association had been organising the event since the ANC and MK’s unbanning. “We are very appreciative and supportive of the ANC branches that are organising the event, more especially on the 100th anniversary birthday centenary of our first leader and our chief commander Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. “We have been invited to the event. We have also witnessed (in the past) the ANC Youth League in the Western Cape organising. “It has always been our call that the ANC and people of South Africa should take initiatives and pride of ownership of their fallen heroes, because their contributions were for the liberation of the people of South Africa, and not for MK. “If it had not been for the contribution of these young lions, such as Ashley Kriel, Anton Fransch and fellow ANC activists such as Dulcie September, who all laid down their lives, it would not have brought about the release of Comrade Nelson Mandela,” Booi said. He urged local ANC structures to maintain the legacy of fallen local ANC heroes such as Kriel, Fransch, September and fellow ANC activists. “We encourage communities to attend in their hundreds to pick up the spear of their fallen heroes,” said Booi. He added that MKMVA’s ex-combatants would be among the various organisations attending the event at 11am.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
