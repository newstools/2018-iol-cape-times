Durban - The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) has revealed some of the findings in its investigation into the Malmesbury Mosque attack that claimed the lives of two people and injured a police officer. On June 14, Noor Abdulle Araale slit the throats of 74-year-old Ismail Bassa and Ziyaad Haseen Hedick, who was the father of 10 children. Araale was later killed by the police following a tense stand-off. It is believed that Araale was mentally ill and was an outpatient at the Bellville’s Karl Bremer Psychiatric Hospital in 2013. "The motive for the attack is not yet established but there are no links to suggest any involvement of extremists or radical activity," the Hawks said in a statement. The circumstances surrounding the death of Araale is being probed by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. The fatal Malmesbury mosque stabbing is the second attack of its kind on a Muslim place of worship in recent months. In May, three knife-wielding men stormed a Shi'a mosque in Durban. The suspects cut Abbas Essop’s throat, who later died in hospital. Two other people were injured in the incident. IOL
