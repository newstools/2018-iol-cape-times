CAPE TOWN - MultiChoice claims that its users have shown a strong trend towards live streaming major sports events on its DStv Now app. This comes after the company said the number of people using DStv Now in June 2018 was five-times higher than a year ago, according to a report by My Broadband. One of the major contributors towards this increase was the Fifa World Cup 2018, with average weekday usage of the DStv Now app increasing 60% since the beginning of the event. MultiChoice said the peak in concurrent usage for one event was reached on 26 June, during the Nigeria vs Argentina game. The company added that it is working on implementing 4K streaming on its DStv Now app. “We’re continuing to develop DStv Now, with 4K streaming in testing and smart TV and Apple TV apps on their way shortly,”  MultiChoice Chief Operating Officer Mark Rayner told My Broadband. “The other key priority for us is working with the telcos to deliver mobile data propositions that make watching online painless and worry-free for our customers,” said Rayner. In other DStv initiatives, Vodacom, DStv and Supersport have partnered to create a new Sports Ticket. Sports Ticket forms part of the operator’s Social Ticket offering and aims to allow customers to watch sporting event at lower costs.
