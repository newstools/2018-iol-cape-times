Cape Town - The Wynberg Boys’ Junior School has been on lockdown after a “potential security threat” was received of a bomb inside the premises. This is according to school principal Cedric Poleman in a letter distributed to parents on Tuesday. Poleman said the police and the Hawks were aware of the threat and investigating. He said they had been given a deadline of Wednesday to deposit cash at a stipulated address. It was not clear how much money had to be deposited. Poleman said that on Friday police “conducted a sweep of the premises and found no explosives”. “As a campus we have taken additional measures to ensure the safety of staff, pupils and parents. Ultimately, although this threat appears to be a hoax, we will not put any staff members or pupils in any potential danger,” said Poleman. He said precautionary measures included limited access through the Oxford Street entrances over the next two days. Additional, dedicated security guards will be stationed at all entrances and school buildings will only open from 7amtoday. Entry and exit will only be through selected entrances which will be manned. He said on Tuesday a full sweep of the perimeter and buildings of the school was conducted by security staff and it will continue today. “Due to the sensitive nature of the investigations by the SAPS and the Hawks we ask that you please refrain from discussing this situation on social media or WhatsApp groups. "Any further information will be forwarded to you via e-mail or SMS.” Any parent or concerned party should contact the school should they have further enquiries, said Poleman. A parent, who did not want to be named, said she will not send her two children to the school this week until police have cleared the bomb threat. “This is absolutely extreme when bomb threats are happening at school,” she said. Police and the provincial education department did not respond before deadline. Cape Times
