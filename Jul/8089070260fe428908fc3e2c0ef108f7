Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has announced that on Thursday there will be water supply disruptions in Simon’s Town, Glencairn, and Welcome Glen areas. The City said in a statement that the water supply disruption, which will occur between 09:00 and 15:00, was "a necessary step required to provide a new water connection in Simon’s Town". The statement said: "Residents must please ensure that their taps are closed during this period to avoid water waste and/or damage when the water supply is restored. Residents are also advised to then open their taps slowly to reduce stress on their pipework. "Residents are advised to store 5-10 litres of drinking water in clean sealed containers beforehand to minimise inconvenience. The City apologises for the inconvenience." African News Agency/ANA
