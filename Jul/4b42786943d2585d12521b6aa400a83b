Former South African president Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Monday. While the Hawks and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions have yet to confirm the charges, it is believed that Duduzane will face corruption charges linked to a multi-million rand offer allegedly made to former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas on behalf of the Gupta family. In 2015, Jonas claimed that Duduzane was present at a meeting at the Gupta compound in Saxonwold where he was offered a R600 million rand bribe as well as the position of finance minister - which at that point was still held by Pravin Gordhan. If Duduzane, a close associate of the Gupta family who has publicly defended his friendship with them, is charged with contravening the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act it will be the first time that a prominent public figure faces charges related to the state capture scandal. Monday's court appearance follows the 34-year-old businessman's brief detention at OR Tambo International Airport last week when he flew in from Dubai to attend the funeral of his brother Vusi who died of complications due to lupus. His passport was flagged - allegedly because of a criminal case opened against him. According to his lawyer, Rudi Krause, Duduzane was briefly detained at the airport to allow Hawks officers to “confirm his identity”. Duduzane Zuma is due to appear in another Gauteng court on Thursday on charges of culpable homicide. The matter is related to an inquest in 2014 found Duduzane negligent in an accident that claimed the life of Phumzile Dube on February 1 that year. Zuma was found to have recklessly crashed his Porsche 911 into the back of a minibus taxi, causing the fatal crash.
