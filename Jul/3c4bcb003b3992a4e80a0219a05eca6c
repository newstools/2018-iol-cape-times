Gugulethu Fire Station came under attack during a protest about land at about 4.25am on Thursday andÂ was set alight, said Theo Layne, City Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson. "Firefighters were forced to vacate the premises and remained in the drill yard until Metro Police and Law Enforcement had dispersed the protesters," said Layne. "The front of the fire station had sustained severe damage, including the watchroom, engine bay doors and security entrance gate. In addition to the fire station, the Fezeka (municipal) offices at the rear of the station were also set alight. "One office section sustained severe damage. Firefighters from Mitchells Plain Fire Station responded to the incident, but due to blocked roadways, caused by protesters burning tyres, had to take a long detour in order to get to Gugulethu Fire Station. Fortunately no injuries occurred." Gugulethu Fire Station will remain closed at least for the remainder of the day, Layne added.
