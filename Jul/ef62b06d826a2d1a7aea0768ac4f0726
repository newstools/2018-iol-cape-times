“The employee was charged with misconduct on March 28. The hearing was scheduled for April 12 and 13. The educator was dismissed on April 16,” said Western Cape Education Department (WCED) spokesperson Bronagh Hammond. The WCED confirmed it was in possession of pictures and videos showing the former staff member allegedly engaging in sexual activities with pupils of Fairmount Secondary School, situated in Parkwood, and other pupils from another Grassy Park high school. Hammond said the investigation was completed after a hearing was held during April and the matter reported to police. A police source confirmed that they were able to view the footage but did not have it in their possession. “No case has been brought to police yet but after being able to view the footage and pictures, one can clearly see the staff member’s face. “It would seem the acts were consensual but that cannot be confirmed,” the source said. The WCED launched its investigation of the allegations after claims were circulated on Twitter. The user’s initial post directed to the school’s management requested that the staff member be taken to the police "or hell will break loose". “He has been having sex with multiple school girls in uniform. I’ve videos & pix”. The post was accompanied by pictures of a man with other individuals believed to be pupils of Fairmount Secondary and another high school in the Grassy Park area. The faces in the pictures were covered with emojis. Hammond said the department takes reports of sexual misconduct seriously and will investigate each case. “To assist schools in managing child abuse and sexual offences against children, the WCED has made available to schools guidelines called the ‘Abuse No More Protocol’. These guidelines were amended in 2014 in collaboration with a number of government departments, the SAPS, the NPA, and other organisations and institutions, taking into account all relevant legislation,” Hammond said.
