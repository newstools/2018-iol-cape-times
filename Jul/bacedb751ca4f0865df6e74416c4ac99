Some Parkwood residents allegedly brought Prince George Drive to a standstill when they staged protests on Thursday and Friday. Reports were received of apparent protest action flaring again and law enforcement had to stabilise the situation by cordoning off Hyde Road, Dick Burton Street and Prince George Drive, said traffic spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout. Ward councillor Kevin Southgate said the protest spilled over to Southfield where there was damage to property. Parkwood Backyard Dwellers Association chairperson Dominic Booysen said the recent flare-up was criminal and not led by the same group. “We are still waiting on feedback from the City who is set to respond by the end of the month. “In the meantime, we have not condoned any further protest action because innocent people get hurt in the process.” Community leader Paul Phillips said he had distanced himself from all activities with immediate effect. “I have no choice but to distance myself as opportunists have come on board with their own agendas. “I said from the beginning I did not want the housing issue to become a political issue. “It is a community issue,” he added.
