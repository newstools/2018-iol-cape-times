Two men, aged 25 and 28, were arrested on two cases of rape. “Both women were walking at night when they were dragged by the suspects to their residences. “One suspect was arrested while in his residence with the victim and the other suspect was arrested through a tip-off from the community,” said police spokesperson Noloyiso 
Rwexana. The two were among a total of five people arrested for various crimes in the Nyanga precinct, said Rwexana. Two suspects, aged 28 and 34, from Kosovo informal settlement in Philippi handed themselves over to police after allegedly stabbing and killing a 17-year-old girl following an altercation. “It is alleged that the three (all women) had an argument after they had been drinking together. “The pair stabbed the victim and she was rushed to hospital, where she died on arrival,” Rwexana said. In another case, a 30-year-old man was also arrested for being in possession of a stolen vehicle, a white LDV, at Thabo Mbeki informal settlement. Police received information about the suspicious vehicle and, while they were approaching the vehicle, two suspects ran away in an effort to evade arrest. The vehicle had been reported stolen in Nyanga. All five suspects were expected to appear in the Athlone, Wynberg and Philippi magistrate’s courts facing charges of murder, rape and possession of a stolen vehicle.
