Police spokesperson Wesley Twigg said the suspect is expected to appear in court today. No arrests have been made in connection with the murder of 16-year-old Berodine Boyce, who was also killed in the fishing village at the weekend, Twigg said. Community leader Thyrone Williams said residents believed the suspect arrested could also be behind the murder of Boyce, whose body was found in a shallow grave behind the Laingville sports field. Boyceâ€™s mother had reported her missing on July 9. The body was found three days later after a community search. The area was still tense yesterday, Williams said, with police and law enforcement officials present. A memorial will be held for Boyce tomorrow, before her body will be taken to Namaqualand for burial, as she is originally from there.
