Johannesburg - The Western Cape provincial government unanimously agreed on Friday, to the motion that immediate action should be taken to address the violence in Zwelihle,  Hermanus. Democratic Alliance Western Cape spokesperson on local government, Masizole Mnqasela said the violence which has plagued the community of Zwelihle can only be addressed if parliament takes a unified approach. He said party politics should be left out of the equation and focus on capturing the perpetrators of the crime. "The community has suffered a great deal. Innocent bystanders risk losing their jobs, having their communities’infrastructure further decimated by persisting violence, personal injury or worse," Mnqasela said. The party called on communities to engage with all public representatives to avoid current and similar scenes throughout the province. "The solution lies in continuous engagement with affected stakeholders," he said. Police on Friday said a shotgun taken from one of their members --  who was beaten up by people protesting for land and housing in Zwelihle -- was recovered and a suspect is under arrest. "The situation in Zwelihle, Hermanus reached a volatile point last night when one of our members was attacked and severely assaulted by protestors. The member was robbed of his 9mm firearm and shotgun during the attack," said Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut from the South Africa Police Service (SAPS) in the Western Cape. "He was admitted to hospital where he is being treated. Operations to quell the violence in the area were conducted which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old suspect who was caught in possession of the SAPS shotgun and ammunition. "Four other suspects were arrested on charges of public violence. Our deployments will remain on high alert in the area to maintain law and order. The suspects are due in court once they have been charged." African News Agency (ANA)
