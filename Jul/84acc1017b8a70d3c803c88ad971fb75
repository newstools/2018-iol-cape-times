A 25-year-old man was shot dead in his car and another injured in a drive-by shooting in Epping on Tuesday morning, police said. "The victim died due to his injuries, while the other man was wounded and transported to hospital for treatment," said police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana. The shooting occurred at about 4.55am and it is believed the men were shot at while passing the suspects, who were in another car. No further information was immediately available and no one was arrested. The incident is under investigation. Meanwhile, just before 8.30am on Tuesday morning police officers on crime-prevention patrols in Siyayanzela informal settlement in Brown’s Farm, Philippi, came across a blue Mazda 323 sedan that had been stripped of some of its parts and another vehicle which was burnt beyond recognition. The Mazda had been reported stolen at Somerset West police station earlier this month. Officers were unable to identify the other vehicle and trace its origins, police said. Both vehicles were towed to Bellville South SAPS for further investigation. This brings to nine the number of stolen vehicles that metro police officers have recovered in Siyayanzela informal settlement since mid-April. This area has become the hot spot for the dumping of stolen vehicles after thieves have taken the parts they require.
