Cape Town - South African gender organisation, Sonke Gender Justice on Wednesday said it was disappointed by the National Prosecuting Authority’s  (NPA) decision not to prosecute the former higher education deputy minister Mduduzi Manana for allegedly assaulting his domestic worker. The organisation said it also welcomed Manana’s resignation as African National Congress (ANC) member of Parliament which was announced on Tuesday. On Monday, the NPA announced its decision not to prosecute Manana after he allegedly assaulted his helper, Christine Wiro stating that it did not have sufficient evidence and felt that there were no reasonable prospects for a successful conviction. The incident related to Manana allegedly pushing the 53-year-old Wiro down the stairs during a heated argument, leaving her severely bruised. A recording of Manana allegedly trying to bribe Wiro with R100 000 to drop the case surfaced after Wiro laid the charge, with Manana subsequently instituting a charge of extortion against Wiro.
