Cupido was selected out of 200 hopefuls as one of 30 to be part of the Simsport International under 16 and under 18 teams. His goal is to land a study scholarship contract in England for next year. The 18-year-old is currently in matric at Mondale High. He is one of five children who also lost his biggest supporter, his father, to a heart attack last week. “Growing up, my father and my eldest brother inspired me to take my football talent to the next level,” said Cupido. “It was his dream to see me play professionally and this will be an amazing learning experience that can only enhance our skills and open doors for us so that we can also share this with our peers back in South Africa,” he said. Cupido has been playing soccer since the age of 5 and was selected for his high school team since Grade 8. “I enjoy playing football. It is my dream to take it further because this is where I believe I can truly excel,” he added. His mentor Garlen Fredericks is assisting Cupido and the family with their fundraising efforts and tutoring. “Tawfeeq is a very grounded boy, who takes advice. Since he lost his dad he is more determined than ever to fulfil his father’s dreams to become professional," Fredericks said. “His mother is unemployed and they are three boys in matric. "It is tough for them at home. With his talent in soccer, I can see him give himself and his family a better life. “This is a fantastic opportunity for him. They will be playing matches against academy teams, like Liverpool, Manchester, Bolton Wanderers and more. It is amazing exposure.” Anyone who would like to assist the teen and his family can contact Fredericks on 0793972774.
