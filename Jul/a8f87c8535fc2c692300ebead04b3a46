He is also set to face a charge of bribery when he appears in court for allegedly offering a traffic officer R2 000 to let him go. The City’s traffic services spokesperson, Richard Coleman, said the off-duty officer was caught in a roadblock in Bishop Lavis on Saturday. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the 52-year-old from Bloubergstrand, driving a VW minibus, was arrested just after 5.30pm. Van Wyk said the man was charged and released on bail on Sunday. Meanwhile, Coleman said, a roadblock in Kuils River on Friday netted 30 suspects for driving under the influence, while a roadblock in Delft yesterday netted 29 suspects for the same offence. Over the past week, 130 suspects were arrested for drunk driving, outstanding warrants and possession of illegal firearms and drugs. “Officers also impounded 51 vehicles and issued 2358 fines for various other offences. “On the same evening, a drag racing operation in the Athlone and Manenberg area netted 11 suspects, one of whom was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm. “The firearm will be sent for ballistic testing to determine whether it can be linked to criminal acts,” Coleman said. Metro police spokesperson Ruth Solomons said a taxi driver was arrested for assaulting a traffic officer during a routine traffic stop. “Officers had their hands full on Thursday, when they tried to interview a taxi driver who committed a traffic violation in Bellville. Instead of just a ticket, the 39-year-old was arrested for riotous behaviour, assault on an officer and resisting arrest. “Later, during the same operation, officers arrested two suspects, aged 27 and 29, after finding drugs in their vehicle. “When they checked the vehicle, they discovered that the chassis number had been tampered with. ‘“The vehicle was seized and taken to Stikland SAPS for further investigation,” Solomons said.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za  Cape Times
