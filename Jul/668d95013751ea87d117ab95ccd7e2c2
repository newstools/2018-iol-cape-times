Baby Senelile* was found abandoned in a field in Pretoria, and it is still not known who her parents are. Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR) took up the case after the department refused a social worker’s request for a birth certificate for her. The organisation yesterday said Senelile not having a birth certificate meant she was not able to be adopted by her foster parents who had been caring for her since her abandonment. She had also been in need of emergency health care, which her foster parents were able to provide even though their medical aid rejected the claim because she was undocumented. “Senelile was ultimately refused access to her constitutional right to a name and a nationality from birth (section 28), which is unacceptable. “If reports from different social workers are correct, the department has taken the decision not to register foundling abandoned babies, and we as a society should be very concerned for vulnerable children. “These reports, along with the fact that LHR is representing several abandoned children in the same position, is proof that the department has either taken such a decision or at the very least is not doing enough to ensure that local offices are informed of the law requiring such children to be registered,” they said. The department did not respond to requests for comment yesterday. LHR said the Pretoria Children’s Court had agreed with its argument, and an order was issued for the department to register her. “Senelile is now registered. She is protected from trafficking. She is secure in the family where she is loved,” they said. * Senelile is not the child’s real name.
