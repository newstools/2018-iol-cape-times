In clinching the medal, the six-member South African team of high school pupils’ performances at the event ensured their country’s ranking at number 62 out of 107 countries. The event took place from July 3 to 14, with 615 contestants from 107 countries participating. South Africa’s team comprised of six Capetonian pupils including Adri Wessels of Curro Durbanville, Taariq Mowzer of Fairbairn College and Emil van der Walt of Hoërskool Jan van Riebeeck - all in Grade 11. Tim Schlesinger of Rondebosch Boys’ High School, Emile Tredoux of Parklands College and Ralph McDougall of Curro Durbanville are all in Grade 12. They have been training under the watchful eyes of team leaders Liam Baker and Phil Labuschagne. Tredoux said: “The opportunity to represent my country abroad has always been one of my goals. “Being in Romania afforded me the opportunity to meet other like-minded individuals who enjoy doing maths as well.” Mowzer, Schlesinger and McDougall, as well as the only new team member, Wessels, each received honourable mentions for solving at least one question correctly. The top five countries at the 2018 IMO in ranking order were the US with five gold medals and a silver medal, the Russian Federation with five gold medals and a silver medal, the People’s Republic of China with four gold medals and two silver medals, Ukraine with four gold medals and two silver medals, and Thailand with three gold medals and three silver medals. The six-member SA team and other top-performing local pupils will now compete for the South African Mathematics Olympiad’s Dirk van Rooy Gold Medal, which is awarded at the national awards of the South African Mathematics Foundation on September 23. South Africa has participated in the IMO since 1992, scoring its highest ranking of 27th in 2000. South Africa recently won the Pan African Mathematics Olympiad and was again the best African country to participate in the 2018 IMO, in which 11 African countries took part.
