The City says the Lansdowne library will remain closed indefinitely following the severing of wires of the book detection system. This after library users, among them Edwin Davies, said they were left stranded after the library was closed on April 9. The 71-year-old said he did not have internet at home and relied on the library to access the internet. He wrote to the director of libraries and said: “On July 2, I went to the library and there was a note that read due to unforeseen circumstances, the library will only reopen on July 16 On July 16 there was a note that read that due to unforeseen circumstances, the library will reopen shortly, no date given. "Difficult to accept this, especially as I walked round the library on Sunday to see if there were any further delays and there was no notification, so I went there expecting the library to be open, which was not the case,” Davies said. The City's Mayco member for social services, JP Smith, said the library would open when the book detection system was up and running. It costs about R676 200. “The contractor accidentally severed the wires of the book detection system while he was working. "A deviation report has been submitted for approval for the required emergency repairs to the book detection system. "When that is approved, the book detection system will be fixed and the library will reopen. "Unfortunately we don't have timelines currently, as there are dependencies outside of our control,” Smith said. He advised Lansdowne library users to utilise services offered at the nearest libraries in Athlone and Hanover Park. The library's walls, ceilings, doors, windows and frames are being painted, and the floors are being tiled. A new staff room is being built and ramps, rails and a safety gate are being installed.  francesca.villette@inl.co.za
