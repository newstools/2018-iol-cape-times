These “Sparks of Hope” are carrying forward the flag of freedom Madiba waved and we are proud to stand in solidarity with them. July 18 marks a special centenary, where the world over we celebrate what would have been Madiba’s 100th birthday. A remarkable human being who held no bitterness against his oppressors, but who practised forgiveness and encouraged compassion and justice for all. A man who had the vision and was the founder of The Elders. A group that would spread the word and remind each of us of his legacy, but more importantly how to change the world with our actions. How each of us could be the catalyst of beautiful change. Sparks of Hope is comprised of peacemakers, human right defenders, justice advocates, feminist campaigners, LGBT rights fighters and community health workers. This is with the hope to work together for the freedoms that all humans should enjoy. The Elders will champion the Sparks of Hope programme to elevate their work and to create a passion in all of us to stand up and make a difference. To honour Madiba’s legacy the best way we know how, by uplifting each other, fighting any form of oppression and creating a better world for our children. Madiba believed a positive outcome would only be achieved by retaining our integrity, decency and fairness, especially by those in power. The world has witnessed, even to this day, the atrocity that there are still millions being deprived of their basic human rights. The Elders will continue to speak up for those who cannot to call on leaders and ordinary citizens to fight for equality and justice. On July 17 and 18, The Elders and Sparks of Hope from around the world, will #Walk Together in Johannesburg to honour Madiba’s 100th birthday. Fathima Ebrahim Edelman South Africa
