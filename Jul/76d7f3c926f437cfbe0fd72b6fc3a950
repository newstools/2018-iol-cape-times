Zuma’s son Vusi Nhlakanipho's funeral will be taking place in Joburg on the day. The 25-year-old died on Sunday at Milpark Hospital due to complications of systematic lupus erythematosus, known as lupus, which he was diagnosed with. Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when the body’s immune system attacks its own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems, including the joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs. Family spokesperson Linda Makatini said a memorial service involving close family and friends for the young Zuma would be held today. The funeral service will take place on Saturday at 9 am at the Rhema Recreational Centre in Randburg, to be followed by burial at West Park Cemetery. Makatini said the family were gathering daily for prayers at his home in Forest Town between 6 pm and 7 pm. The Zuma family also conveyed their gratitude for the messages of condolences and support since the news of Vusi’s death. “The Zuma family would like to express their heartfelt gratitude for the warm messages of support extended to them by the nation, both in private and in public. "Your messages have brought us much-needed comfort during this difficult time of grief" the family said. Vusi was born to Zuma's late wife Kate Mantsho, who committed suicide in 2000 when Vusi was eight. He was the youngest of five children and his siblings include well-known Zuma twins Duduzile and Duduzane, an associate of the controversial Gupta family. Political Bureau
