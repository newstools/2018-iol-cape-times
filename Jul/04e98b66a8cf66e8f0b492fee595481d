The company released a statement yesterday saying: “Following a worldwide product recall issued by the Hungarian Food Safety Agency, and purely as a precautionary measure, we are recalling our Woolworths Frozen Savoury Rice Mix product (6009173621740).” The retailer said the Greenyard Factory had been implicated as the potential source of a Listeria outbreak in Europe. They said none of their other frozen sweetcorn or vegetable products were affected. “Food safety is of critical importance to Woolworths, and we take all issues regarding the production of our food extremely seriously.” Woolworths said they proactively manage and prevent microbial contamination of food, adding that the product had been tested and found compliant. However, customers who have purchased the product, should return it to their local store for a full refund.
