Africa (née Petiteaud) spent the special day with those near and dear to her, with a table creaking under cakes and bouquets of flowers. “I have had a busy day since early morning already when a radio show did an interview with me. Since then, our house has been busy all day. Church people also came to give their well-wishes and it has been a very special day,” she said. Africa, who admits she enjoyed the attention, said she was woken with a full breakfast. “I was really spoilt today with lots of presents, flowers and cakes. I love the flowers especially because I loved gardening when my knees were not as problematic,” she said. The backyard of Africa’s home was decked out with chairs and a table with treats for anyone who popped in for a visit. Africa, who was born in Simons Town and later moved to Elsies River, said her secret to a long life was eating fresh vegetables and enjoying a glass of whisky with water every day.

Africa who enjoyed her youth dancing at Woodstock Town Hall and “visiting the bioscope” said living in Elsies River has given her many memories. “Elsies River isn’t what it used to be, but we still hold on to the special memories of years gone by. I used to love going to the bioscope and I enjoyed ballroom dancing. My favourite types of dance is langarm and the waltz. “Celebrating my 100th birthday the same year that Mandela would have been 100 is quite special. I always used to tell my children that I wondered who would go first,” she laughed.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
