The organisation receives many calls for warm clothing and blankets at this time of extreme cold in the country. In addition, its churches provide hot soup and bread to hundreds of people every week throughout the year. Major Carin Holmes, PR secretary for the southern Africa region of The Salvation Army says: “This winter is proving particularly cold. I appeal to the public to give generously to support the homeless and needy through the work of The Salvation Army. “Giving can be as easy as sending an SMS message to our helpline, 42290, with the word “Winterhelp” in the SMS. The cost of the SMS is only R30, the majority of which goes towards assisting the needy,” Holmes added. Warm clothes and blankets are also welcome and can be taken to the local Salvation Army church for distribution. Alternatively, members of the public can make direct contributions into the bank account of The Salvation Army. Details are: Bank: First National Bank Branch: Braamfontein Branch code: 251905 Account name: Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal Account number: 50540087604 Reference: Please give your name and “Winterhelp” as a reference. Companies wishing to contribute in kind are asked to contact Major
