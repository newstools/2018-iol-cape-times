Cape Town - The ANC says land expropriation without compensation will be a mixed scheme including private land ownership, allaying fears that private bonded homes will also be expropriated. The party's Western Cape branch kicked off their provincial land summit in Stellenbosch on Friday. In a statement issued by the party this week, the summit will "engage Western Cape communities and stakeholders on land reform and redistribution". Ronald Lamola, ANC NEC member tasked with the land issue, said there will be a mixture of ownership. “Our economy is structured on an mixed open system which means that the government cannot own all the land on its own. Title deeds will still be given to ensure that there is private ownership of land and these title deeds will also give security of tenure. "In the past about 87% of our people have been excluded from owning land. That figure is now at 72% which are tackling. We have moved away from restitution and moved over to redistribution. If we continue with restitution, there would very little progress,” Lamola said. The ANC Western Cape has called the summit before the parliamentary hearings into land expropriation without compensation which starts early next month. The summit ends tomorrow.
