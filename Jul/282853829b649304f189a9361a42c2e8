Johannesburg - There were scenes of commotion and confrontation on Thursday morning between opposing groups outside the Randburg Magistrate's Court, where Duduzane Zuma briefly appeared on charges of culpable homicide. Black First Land First (BLF) members, who turned up with placards, called for the arrest of the last apartheid president F.W De Klerk. They were chanting "arrest De Klerk, hands off Zuma" in apparent support for former president Jacob Zuma's son. Members of the BLF were also involved in confrontations with Afriforum, which says Duduzane has a case to answer. BLF members physically prevented Afriforum CEO Kallie Kriel from entering the court building. Kriel who was shouted at as he walked towards the court said people who were supporting Duduzane were not being sympathetic towards the victims. Duduzane is being charged for the deaths of two minibus taxi passengers following an accident in February 2014. Zimbabwe national Phumzile Dube died after Duduzane's Porsche collided with the minibus taxi in which she was travelling. Another passenger Nanki Jeanette Mashaba‚ who was injured in the accident‚ later died in hospital. A heavy police presence ensured that matters did not get out of hand.

Former president Zuma was seen sitting inside a car parked outside the court, but he did not alight during his son's brief court appearance. The culpable homicide case against Duduzane, was on Thursday postponed by the Randburg Magistrate's Court, after a brief hearing, to August for disclosure. It was the second time this week that Duduzane appeared in court. On Monday, the younger Zuma was in the dock over a R600 million bribe allegedly offered to then deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas in order to do the bidding of his business partners - the controversial Gupta brothers Ajay and Atul. The businessman was released on R100 000 bail after he appeared in court shackled with leg irons. Duduzane, who has been out of the country for several months, returned to South Africa a week ago and attended the weekend burial of his brother Vusi. African News Agency/ANA
