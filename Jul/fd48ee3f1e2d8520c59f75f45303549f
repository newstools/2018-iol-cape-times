The western half of the Eastern Cape will experience cloudy and cold conditions with rain and scattered but isolated showers along the coast and adjacent interior west of Cape St Francis. It will be partly cloudy and cold to cool in the eastern half of the Easter Cape, becoming cloudy with scattered showers from late morning. Snow is expected to fall over the southern Drakensberg from Friday evening. The Western Cape will experience cool weather along the south-coast, while cloudy and cold conditions will prevail over the rest of the province,  with rain showers abating during the morning, except in the extreme west.
