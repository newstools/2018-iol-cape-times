The shock news of Max’s move to Cele’s office broke last Friday and it has been rumoured that Max will advise on the drug trade and gangsterism. Early on Saturday, Max would not be drawn on the move and maintained that he was still a DA member and member of the legislature. “For now I can’t say anything. I am still with the DA and up until the minister has confirmed it, then I am not going to comment,” he said. But three hours later, Max invited the media to a press conference at the upmarket Pepper Club Hotel. “The press conference will cover my appointment as special adviser to the National Minister of Police and the call by President Cyril Ramaphosa for all South Africans to contribute to the ethos and success of ‘Thuma Mina’,” Max’s invitation read. It stated that Max was a former member of the Western Cape Legislature, indicating that he intended to resign from his position. It remains unclear if Max is still a DA member as he would not be drawn on this. Masizole Mnqasela, Max’s friend and confidant, posted on Facebook: “Your police experience is very much needed in SA today.” @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
