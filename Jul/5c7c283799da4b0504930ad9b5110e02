“All I can confirm is that we are investigating rape allegations against a police officer from Lwandle which allegedly happened on July 4. I don’t have more details. There is no statement (taken from the suspect) as the details are very sketchy. No arrest has been made,” said Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini. Fourteen days since the incident, the suspected police officer was still working and no internal disciplinary proceedings have been instituted. Dlamini said Ipid has yet to see the woman’s statement. He said Ipid came to know about the incident last week when he received an inquiry from the media. The incident allegedly took place when the officer and his colleague were after the woman’s boyfriend in connection with a crime he had allegedly committed. Sonke Gender Justice policy development and advocacy specialist, Marike Keller, said: “It is imperative that Ipid takes cases such as this seriously. "Also, that Ipid immediately conducts an investigation into the alleged perpetrating officer following an immediate suspension until such time as the investigation has been fully and thoroughly conducted.” A more co-ordinated response across government departments in responding to and preventing gender violence was needed, Keller said. “We need sensitivity training for police to ensure that they do not perpetuate secondary victimisation, which causes further harm to a survivor. “Most of all, we need government to provide sufficient human and monetary resources to effectively address and combat gender-based violence.” Police referred questions to Ipid.
