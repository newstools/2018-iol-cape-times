Cape Town - The impasse between Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and the DA is set to intensify. DA national spokesperson Solly Malatsi confirmed that the party will be appealing an earlier ruling by the Western Cape High Court that saw De Lille’s axing reversed and her party membership restored. “In terms of the court’s rules, the DA has filed for leave to appeal the Western Cape High Court’s as part of our commitment to due process, and as a result of the fact that they are far-reaching implications of the judgment, that go much further than De Lille matter itself, and while we fully respect the courts, we believe that the court erred in its decision making in a number of critical areas, and these will form the basis of our appeal,” Malatsi said. The High Court last month set aside the DA's decision to terminate De Lille's membership for comments she made during a radio interview in April. Last month, a full Bench, led by Judge Andre le Grange, ruled that the party's determination that she ceased to be a member was "unlawful and not procedural, returning De Lille's membership". By virtue of this ruling, De Lille returned to her position. Added to the attacks on De Lille, the City of Cape Town voted to strip De Lille of most of her powers in a motion passed on May 31. The council is, however, backtracking on its decisions and the council meeting to be held on July 26 will reverse many of the decisions taken. Cape Argus
