The area has seen sporadic violence that led to the shutting down of four schools and a local clinic. Angry residents demanded the release of the leader of Zwelihle Renewal, which they claim has been targeted. The municipality said the damages could take more than R40 million to repair. Mount Pleasant School was one of the affected schools, with its perimeter fence and some windows and doors damaged. Resident Marthunis Barnard said: “Education and the safety of children have always been close to my heart, so as a resident of Hermanus I wanted to do something positive. “So I went to MyWhaleCoast, a page that I created on Facebook, and asked if people would want to donate and fix the damaged schools. Many people got on board, even some businesses. “We are currently fixing Mount Pleasant and Waldorf schools, and hopefully will be done by Thursday. This just shows what we can achieve when united. In total, we raised more than R670000, and that in just a week.” Yesterday 18 residents who faced different charges related to the protests appeared at the Hermanus Magistrate’s Court.
