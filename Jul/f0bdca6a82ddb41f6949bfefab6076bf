Cape Town - The launch of the much-anticipated, innovative THE DAILY MUSIC SHOW will take place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre on Thursday.

The show will use music, the universal language, to showcase our rich cultural heritage as a learning and discovery experience for international tourists, with locals providing context and hospitality. Music, in particular, and the arts in general, will be the focus around which the producer adds interesting features, including celebrity co-hosts, special guest interviews, songs off the SA top 100 list, against the odds features that will highlight the achievements of young people despite their circumstances, introduce young artists to the world stage, and showcase hidden gems of the tourism industry. The format of the evening:  The launch will feature The Hilton Schilder Quartet and Steve Fataar (The Flames) as headline acts, supported by Denise Newman (Suidooster), The Rosa Choir and Gail van Breda (SoulStrokes). Special guests on the night include Rashid Lombard (photo-journalist), Ryland Fisher (author and Arts thought leader) and Dr Shirley Zinn (author and motivational speaker). “Cultural tourism has a positive economic and social impact. Besides sharing and reinforcing our identity, it helps to build image, it helps preserve our cultural and historical heritage. "Through an entertaining medium like THE DAILY MUSIC SHOW, we interact substantially with visitors to our shores. By telling stories about our history, our people, our art and other elements that shape our way of life, we will give tourists a better understanding of Cape Town and South Africa as a whole” says producer, Joey Fourie.
