They demanded urgent safety and security resources to be sent to the area. The community group Let’s Help Each Other hosted the peaceful march where a memorandum and petition was handed to the Ocean View station commander. They want more police deployed due to a spate of shootings they said were related to gang fights. This comes after four people were shot dead in the area over the past two weeks. The most recent killing was on Thursday. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said no arrests had yet been made. “A murder case has been opened following a shooting incident that occurred on Thursday at 8.10am at Milky Way, Ocean View. According to reports, an unidentified man in his thirties was found on the street with a gunshot wound to his head,” Rwexana said. A resident, who did not want to be named out of fear of reprisal, said they marched in solidarity and unity against crime. “We want to show SAPS and the ill elements that we are fed up with crime in our area. We are raising families in this community and not being
able to do so in a safe environment is a real struggle,” he said. Ocean View CPF chairperson Kathy Cronje said they echoed the sentiments of the community group and identified at least five crime hot spots where rival gangs are fighting for drug turf. “As residents we feel we have been forgotten behind this mountain and police need to do more to protect us. “We need all safety and security agencies to heed our call and come on board. “Because of the huge outcry by our community we will also host a community meeting on Thursday evening at the multi-purpose centre,” Cronje said.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
