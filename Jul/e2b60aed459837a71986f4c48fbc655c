Cape Town - Be prepared for a delay in the delivery of your rates bill or renewal notices from the City of Cape Town. This is due to the ongoing Post Office strike. The City of Cape Town put out a statement informing the public about possible delays. "The South African Post Office (SAPO) has informed the City of Cape Town about possible delays in the postal delivery of municipal accounts. Until recently, the City was not affected by the ongoing postal worker’s strike," the City said. "Unfortunately, the protracted SAPO strike will be affecting the delivery of some municipal invoices for the month of July 2018 and may also affect the delivery of motor vehicle licence discs which have been applied for online over the past two weeks. "The City would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused as a result of the ongoing strike. When received, the invoice will still reflect the due date but interest charges will not be levied for any late receipt of payment as a result of the delays caused by the strike. "In the interim, if customers have already registered on the City’s e-services portal, they will be able to access their information by logging in to their online account," the City said. Residents with valid cell phone numbers on the City’s billing system should receive an SMS reflecting the amount due for payment, it said. Ratepayers were also encouraged to check their previous month's invoice and pay a similar amount, plus a bit extra, to take into account the tariff increases. Customers who have recently renewed their motor vehicle licences online may also experience a delay in receiving their motor vehicle licence disc due to the strike. 
"We encourage motorists to rather renew their discs at the City’s motor vehicle licence renewal offices across the metro should they need their disc urgently," the City said. @CapeTimesSA Cape Times
