Parliament - Following Parliament's failure to successfully subpoena Duduzane Zuma to appear before the Eskom Inquiry, interested MPs will have to, on their own accord, open criminal cases against him, says Parliament. The Public Enterprises Committee said in a statement on Monday that Parliament had tried to locate Duduzane, but to no avail. ""The subpoena was issued by Parliament and not by the committee, as such the decision to subpoena Duduzane Zuma lies with Parliament. Furthermore, after it transpired that Duduzane Zuma could not be located when the subpoena was issued, the Speaker Baleka Mbete, advised the committee that other avenues were opened to the committee, and if individual members of the committee wanted to take the matter further by opening a case at a police station, they could do so," said the committee. Mbete advised that committee members could also make recommendation on what steps should be followed when they present the report to the National Assembly. It is not clear when the report will be presented to Parliament. The Public Enterprise Committee held the Eskom Inquiry for months interrogating the submissions of various individuals about the allegations of state capture at the power utility. Former board members and executives such as Brian Molefe and Ben Ngubane were interrogated on their role in the capture of Eskom. Many people pointed to the infamous Gupta families influence with assistance of their friend former president Jacob Zuma, Dudu Myeni and Duduzane. It was decided that subpoenas would be issued to the Guptas, Myeni and Duduzane. However, the trio have avoid appearing before the committee. Politics Hub
