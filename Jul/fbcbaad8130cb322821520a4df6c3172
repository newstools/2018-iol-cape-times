The mostly educational books were donated to the Community Chest by businesses, organisations and individuals, said Community Chest spokesperson Desiré Goliath. She said the “Bree Street Mandela Day Book Mountain” book collection drive was inspired by the Community Chest’s 90th anniversary and by Madiba and his zeal for education. Colourful banners from the Community Chest, the Cape Town Drug Counselling Centre, Leisure Education Trust, Leliebloem Child and Youth Care Centre and Robben Island Shakespeare 2016 Schools Festival formed a backdrop. The collected books will be donated to Masigcine Ikhaya Labantwana Children’s Home in Mfuleni and to the Philippi Children’s Centre. “We’re here to celebrate Mandela’s centenary and 90 years of Community Chest, which stands for service, much like Mandela did. Mandela loved reading, he loved education and he loved kids most of all,” said Goliath. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Community Chest executive officer Lorenzo Davids said Statistics South Africa indicated that 54.6% of children were regularly “provided stimulation” through reading or telling stories. “There is an undeniable link between engaging children through reading and improving their performance at school. This is why we have decided to place reading at the forefront again this Mandela Day.” Philippi Children’s Centre administrator Shamiela Schippers said: “We always look forward to July 18, because we receive donations that are desperately needed. “These books will not only help improve literacy levels, but help our children to escape and keep their childhood alive through fairy tales.” The Chest encourages the public to continue contributing books.
