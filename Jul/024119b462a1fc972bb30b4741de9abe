While police said it was not clear how the fire started, the family of 28-year-old Rorisang Molao believed it was an arson attack. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said an inquest docket was under investigation and the fire only affected the couple’s home. Molao’s remains were found among the ruins after firefighters had extinguished the fire. Molao’s brother Tsepo said: “The girlfriend told residents before she was taken to hospital that someone who had an argument with Rorisang had on Saturday night threatened to burn him inside his shack. "We have every reason to believe it was arson now that the fire occurred within hours after the threat. When she is discharged she will tell the police what exactly happened and who made the threat,” said Molao. “Everything was lost in the fire and it is by chance someone kept a copy of his ID,” he said. Ward councillor Simthembile Mfecane said it was also suspected that illegally connected electricity wires triggered the fire. “People connect illegally from the electricity poles on the pavement, which is dangerous in their households. Every two weeks in this area we hear of a fire as a result of illegally connected electricity and destroyed homes,” said Mfecane.
