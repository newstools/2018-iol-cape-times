Berodine was a pupil at Louwville High School, and at the memorial service a classmate said she was the “light of their lives”, and will be missed dearly. “To see a smile on Berodine’s face made our day. She always made us laugh, and knew how to put smiles on our faces; she did it so easily. “We will miss her a lot, especially in history class,” a classmate said.

A suspect was arrested the next day.  francesca.villette@inl.co.za
