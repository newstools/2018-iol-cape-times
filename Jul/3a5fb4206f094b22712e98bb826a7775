Stanton Mano, who was jailed along with Carlo de Kock in October last year, was released from custody yesterday after the charges against him were dropped, leaving De Kock, Charnelle’s uncle, to face the charges. He allegedly raped and killed McCrawl before disposing of her body at the Vygieskraal riverbank in Manenberg. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila confirmed that the charges had been withdrawn. “There were no prospects of a successful prosecution,” he said. McCrawl was reported missing on October 19 after she failed to arrive at school. A police source confirmed that traces of human blood were found in a wheelie bin and a backyard dwelling in Audrey Court, Manenberg, after her body was found. According to reports, CCTV footage aided in the successful arrest. Previously, both De Kock and Mano applied for bail but this was denied as magistrate Goolam Bawa said the acts were “barbaric”. A forensics report showed she suffered multiple blunt-force injuries to her head, neck and genital areas. DNA testing led to the semen traces found on her pants. The State also indicated it would be revisiting two sexual assault cases against De Kock.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
