The Rene Roman Search and Rescue Team, Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum (CPF), family, residents and volunteers joined police in ensuring Mobe was reunited with her family at the weekend. Mitchells Plain CPF secretary Lynn Phillips said she was called to assist in the search on Saturday. “The mother informed us she last saw her daughter, 14, stepping out with money and she never returned. It was either she was a runaway or she was abducted, but we live in a cruel world so we wanted to act fast. “During our searches a man said his son informed him Nava was grabbed into a minibus taxi,” said Phillips. They intensified the search and contacted every hospital and mortuary in Cape Town, but with no luck. “After 10pm the search was called off. Then at around 11pm I received a call that the child was found at Somerset Hospital. We are happy that the child was reunited with her family. “We urge all parents to always know where their child is going. Some parents don’t know their children’s friends, teachers and wait long to report cases,” Phillips said. Nontando Goshani, a Wallacedene, Kraaifontein, mother is having sleepless night after her daughter Aphiwe went missing. The 22-year-old, who is six months' pregnant, was last seen at 3pm by her friend going to board a taxi from Delft to go back to Wallacedene. Gcobani Mahlokozi, 9, who is mentally disabled and has a speech impediment, was found in Malmesbury on Monday after being missing for four days. He ran away from his mother in Shoprite in Lwandle, Strand. Cape Times
