The organisation held its second land summit at the weekend to explore how it will address and stop the increasing land grabs in Khayelitsha. They called on the City to double its efforts to stop land invasions, which it described as political posturing and blatant disregard for the law. The spate of land invasions, lack of housing opportunities and crime were among the issues under the spotlight during the summit, which was attended by community leaders, City and provincial government officials. KDF chairperson Ndithini Tyhido said: “Our view is that the best thing any community can do for itself is to look its problem in the eye and deal with it. “We are appreciative of the Khayelitsha Community Trust’s view on turning its programme for about 368 houses to be a fully subsidised programme. “If it’s true that the housing waiting list has increased from 400000 to 575000 surely there is a problem and for as long as that is the case we will see more shacks being erected in Khayelitsha. Khayelitsha Initiation Forum chairperson, Tobile Mtotywa, said his organisation has been left scrambling for land to use for this winter’s initiation season because the lands they used to use have either been illegally occupied or major housing developments have been planned. “It is unfair for our culture. Where are we expected to continue with this ritual?” Mtotywa asked. On lack of housing opportunities, head of department at provincial human settlements, Thando Mguli, said there were three major housing projects earmarked including the development of Taiwan informal settlements along the N2. Khayelitsha cluster commander Johan Brand said land invasion lead to violent protests.
