Police have arrested a 33-year-old man from Harare in Khayelitsha regarding the death of a five-year-old girl from Makhaza in Khayelitsha. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the preliminary investigation showed that the five-year-old girl went missing after she had been playing at her grandmother’s residence at about 6pm on Monday. “The child left for home, but she never arrived. The community started searching for her and her clothes were found near a shack, where her body was found shortly after. She had sustained stab wounds to her chest,” said Rwexana. Once the man has been charged for murder and rape, he will appear at the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court. Police hailed the positive contribution of partnership policing in the fight against crime after a swift response by the police. “The SAPS management encourages the community to join hands with the police in protecting children from ruthless criminals who prey on them,” Rwexana said.
