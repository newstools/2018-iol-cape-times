The father of two was shot dead while collecting scrap metal from bins in an industrial area on Friday. Yesterday, the crowd outside the packed court demanded the suspect, a businessman, be denied bail as he was “a threat to citizens”. Ward councillor Colin Wilskut said residents came out in their numbers to support Jacobs’ mother, Dina Adams, and his sister Heloise Jacobs, who witnessed the incident. “He (the accused) showed no emotion, barely giving recognition to his family in the first row in the gallery. He did not apply for bail today and we are glad he will stay behind bars and have been told by the State prosecutor we can submit our argument for bail to be denied,” Wilskut said. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said that a 44-year-old man was arrested immediately after the incident and would make his court appearance in Worcester yesterday. Former Community Policing Forum chairperson Guido Opperman said the details of what transpired were not clear. Jacobs was said to have been embroiled in an altercation with the man while he and his sister were in the industrial area. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: “The suspect appeared in court this (yesterday) morning. The case has been postponed until July 31 for a bail application. “He currently faces a charge of murder and will remain in custody until his next court appearance.”
