Johannesburg - Suspended SA Revenue Services (Sars) commissioner Tom Moyane will on Monday brief journalists on his legal woes and a response from President Cyril Ramaphosa after he demanded that one of the two current Sars investigations be halted. Moyane wrote directly to Ramaphosa last week, giving him until Friday, July 6 to respond to his demands or face legal action. This came after retired Judge Robert Nugent dismissed his application to stop the inquiry Nugent chairs to investigate tax administration and governance at Sars. Moyane further demanded that some of the evidence at inquiry be expunged. The beleaguered former Sars boss is also facing a disciplinary hearing. Ramaphosa met the Friday 4pm deadline, with Moyane's lawyer David Mabuza saying in a statement his client was ''pleased'' with the response but refrained from divulging the contents of the president's response. In the letter to Ramaphosa, Moyane said he was being treated unfairly by facing two parallel investigations. He also demanded the removal of Professor Michael Katz, appointed along with advocate Mabongi Masilo and Vuyo Kahla to help Nugent on the inquiry. Moyane alleged that Katz's appointment by Ramaphosa was illegal as the two have a close business relationship ''more specifically, but not limited to him being your personal and business attorney in respect of past and present legal proceedings'', Moyane wrote. Moyane headed Sars for four years during which it missed its revenue collection targets running into billions of rands and was widely viewed as having become a tool in the power struggle between former president Jacob Zuma and his political foes. Moyane is defended by legal eagle and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) chairman Dali Mpofu. African News Agency/ANA
