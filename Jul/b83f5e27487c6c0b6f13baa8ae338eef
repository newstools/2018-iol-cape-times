This was according to Rishabh Thapar, associate director at HVS Africa, who said on Tuesday Cape Town experienced up to a 20% decrease in arrivals in the year to date. He said June and July were among the lowest occupancy months for Cape Town, and the market this year had already seen a double-digit occupancy and revenue-per-available-room decline compared to the year to May last year. “In the month of May, for example, the organised branded hotel inventory recorded a relative decrease of 14.5% in occupancy levels, ending the month at less than 54% occupancy. Similarly, the average room rate decreased by 7%, resulting in revenue per available room of R700,” said Thapar. Mayor Patricia de Lille said it would take at least three years for the City to deal with the impact of drought and climate change. “I believe that Cape Town will emerge as one of the most water-resilient cities in the world because of how we had to adapt and how we also had to mitigate all of the challenges,” she said. Thapar said that because of these efforts, together with the recent rainfall, the dams supplying the City with water were at 55.1% as of yesterday, with healthy rainfall predicted for the rest of the season. “While Capetonians are cautiously optimistic, the frightening experience over the last year has left citizens environmentally conscious, water-wise and fully equipped to handle the new lifestyle changes.” Wesgro chief executive Tim Harris applauded the efforts, saying Cape Town and the province had set a global standard for responsible water consumption. @TheCapeArgus  sizwe.dlamini@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
