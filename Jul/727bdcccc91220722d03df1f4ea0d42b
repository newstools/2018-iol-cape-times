Cape Town - The dams feeding the Western Cape have reached an average level of 48.7%, a stark increase from a year ago, where levels were still at 25%. The dams feeding Cape Town were at 54.7%, the department of environmental affairs and development planning said. The biggest dam in the province, Theewaterskloof, that was critically low just months ago, was at 40%, local government MEC Anton Bredell said. “The dam was in a terrible state only weeks ago, reaching levels of below 10%. It is reassuring to see the levels increasing to above 40% and the levels are expected to continue rising.” Bredell said the situation in the Gouritz River Catchment area remained serious. “This area feeds the Karoo, Groot Karoo and Langkloof regions. The necessary relief has not yet been felt in this area.” Bredell said the provincial situation began turning around towards the end of April, with an average dam level for the province of 16%. “We are now nearing 50% and there is still a month and a half of the winter left. We remain hopeful for further rainfall but continue to urge consumers to keep water use low ahead of the coming summer season,” Bredell said.  @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
