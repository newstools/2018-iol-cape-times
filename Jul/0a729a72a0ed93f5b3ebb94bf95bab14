The national #100MenMarch to stop violence against women and children, organised by government as part of the centenary celebrations for former president Nelson Mandela and struggle stalwart Albertina Sisulu, takes place in Pretoria today. While you may not be able to join the march, you can still show your support by signing the online petition against gender-based violence here. This is the pledge that accompanies the petition: My pledge to end violence against women and children. Change begins with me, and I can motivate others to end violence against women and children. I pledge to help break the culture of silence that accompanies violence and abuse. I pledge not to commit violence and to act when I see violence against women and children. I pledge to teach those in my care the values of human dignity, equality and respect. At least 100 men from various sectors of society, such as government, business, labour, faith-based organisations, non-profit and media organisations are participating in the event, which also forms part of the #ThumaMina campaign. The march started at 10 am at the corner of Kgosi Mampuru Street and Madiba Street, near Schubart Park in Pretoria and will end at the Union Buildings at around 1 pm. IOL
