Their selection follows the recent successful 30km South African Canoe Marathon Championships, in St Francis Bay, where Christie Mckenzie partnered gym instructor Nixon in ending up in second place. According to Mckenzie, the tide was a big factor in the outcome of the race because it determined their paddling strength and challenged their ability. “It was a tough and gruelling race, mostly because it was our first time in a K2, but we made it work and are excited to see the results,” she said. The sports co-ordinator at the Independent Institute of Education (IIE) Varsity College, Andrew Robert Howitt, praised Mckenzie, 
for her St Francis Bay achievements and for her selection in the South African team headed for Portugal. “It is great to see that Christie’s passion, hard work and commitment
to the sport of paddling has paid off. "Christie demonstrates the true meaning of VC Sports Life and we are extremely proud of her achievements,” said Howitt.
