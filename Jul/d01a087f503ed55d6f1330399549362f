Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said they are now in the process of identifying the bodies dug up after a man was arrested for the murder of Matthyssen. Johan Williams, 47, made his first appearance in the Wellington Magistrate’s Court and faces one charge of murder and another of rape in a different case, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said. Matthyssen went missing from her parents’ home in Kuils River on June 23 and was found buried face down nine days later. This came a month after 16-year-old Deoline Demas’s body was found at a dump site in the same town on June 15. She was reported missing on June 7. On June 18, police arrested a 21-year-old suspect in connection with Demas’s murder. Matthyssen, a single mother from Kuils River, was lured to Wellington under the pretence of a job opportunity. But shortly after arriving in the town, communication with her family stopped. This roused the suspicion of her mother, who went in search of her daughter and stayed in Wellington in the hope of finding her. Family and friends said their final farewell to Matthyssen at the weekend before she was cremated. ANC Western Cape chairperson Faiez Jacobs commended the Wellington SAPS for their commitment to arrest the perpetrators. “The ANC in the Western Cape commends Wellington SAPS detectives for their dedicated efforts in apprehending Williams. “Another body of a young woman was found near Helpmekaar farm. It is believed to be that of Natalie Jonkers, who disappeared six years ago. She was last seen with (Williams). We understand more missing women from the same area from as early as 2012 might be victims of the same serial perpetrator.” Williams will be back in court on Friday. “We call on the community to condemn these cowardly crimes against women by rallying with us at court in opposing bail,” Jacobs said.
