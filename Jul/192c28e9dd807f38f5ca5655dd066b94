The opportunistic robbing of pupils of their cellphones before and after school is a huge problem and pupils have been warned to be wary of strangers when walking to or from school. Thanks to a tip-off, law enforcement officers nabbed two male suspects outside Plumstead High School at about 5.40pm on Thursday, the City of Cape Town said. The officers had acted on a hint that there was a robbery taking place outside Plumstead High. When they arrived at the scene where the incident reportedly took place, they spotted two males running towards Prince George Road. As they were trying to ascertain reasons from the two suspects why they had been running away, a crime victim and her friend arrived and identified the duo as the ones who had robbed her of cellphone. The two suspects, age 20 and 22, were taken to the Diep River police station, where a docket was opened on charges of common robbery and the two suspects remain in custody.
