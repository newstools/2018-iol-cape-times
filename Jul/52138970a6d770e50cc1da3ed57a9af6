Valerie Mitchell, 76, died when her informal dwelling was engulfed by flames yesterday 
morning. Her devastated children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren told of their grief. Her son, Chris Mitchell, 55, said: “I live in Belhar and got a call from my niece, who lives next door to my mother, to let me know there was a fire. I got to the house just after 2am. “We have no idea how the fire started, but we are all devastated. “Everybody was asleep when a cousin called out after seeing the smoke. The people in the other shacks all called out a warning, but my mother couldn’t hear that well and couldn’t move fast enough,” Mitchell said. Valerie’s daughter, Charmaine Bailey, described her mother as a vibrant woman who never sat still. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

She hosted games at her house for the youth, and they loved her too,” Bailey said through tears. Valerie’s great-granddaughter, Creshanda Bailey, 21, said they were a close-knit family who shared a special bond. “When I came out of our shack, all I could see was smoke and flames. Everybody was trying to locate her while the fire raged on. We are broken, but just seeing everybody helping at our house since last night to clean up, shows the impact my great granny made on this community,” she said. City Fire and Rescue spokesperson Theo Layne said the cause of the fire, which left 14 people displaced, had yet to be determined. The family said they would welcome any donations to help with funeral arrangements. Contact Chris at 074 798 1378.
