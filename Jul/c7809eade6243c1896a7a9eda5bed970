Cape Town - Abalone poachers in the Western Cape were no match for SAPS members. On Wednesday afternoon members of Table View police arrested two suspects aged 22 and 27 for being in possession of 3150 units of abalone with an estimated street value of R750 000 after they reacted on a tipoff from an informant. The suspects were followed to their residence where their vehicle and residence were searched. In addition to the abalone, equipment to dry and prepare abalone were also confiscated. In a separate incident, police also arrested a Chinese man in possession of R250 000 worth of abalone in Milnerton.  Swellendam police arrested two suspects aged 58 and 64 last night for being in possession of 1633 units of abalone estimated at around R300 000. The suspects who were driving in Voortrekker Road under suspicious circumstances were forced to stop, and searched. In Melkbostrand a 22-year-old suspect was arrested late last night after he was apprehended for being in possession of 908 units of abalone with a street value to the tune of R126 000. Police members spotted six poachers at Holbaai leaving the water and managed to apprehend one of the suspects. The other five fled and are yet to be arrested. The five suspects are due to make court appearances in Swellendam and Cape Town courts once they have been charged. The Provincial Commissioner of the Western Cape police, Lt Gen KE Jula commended his members for protecting our valuable marine resources, and warned poachers that we will continue to fight the illegal abalone trade in this province.  @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus
