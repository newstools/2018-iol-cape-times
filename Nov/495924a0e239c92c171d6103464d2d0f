A passer-by was filming a family of Egyptian geese – two adults and six goslings – who were crossing the road at the intersection of Spin and Adderley streets when the incident which resulted in the death of two goslings occurred. SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham said: “We have traced the owner of the vehicle and we are now just trying to determine who the driver was. "We are hard at work on this and we will be submitting a docket to the police. We are also expecting more eye-witnesses to come and submit their accounts.” “We are very grateful to the witnesses who have come forward and have already submitted statements as well as photographic and video evidence.” The NSPCA welcomed a ruling that saw two men, Tebogo Maselwane and Thato Manzini, being found guilty and sentenced to effective two-year prison terms for dogfighting. The men were caught in June by inspectors after having made their pit bull terriers participate in a violent organised dogfight. Last week, the NSPCA said Letiya Mercy Lebakeng was sentenced for deliberately throwing a tortoise against a rock in the road after it had apparently wandered into her yard. Cape Times
