Cape Town – An administrative clerk stationed at the Rondebosch police station made a brief first appearance in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday on charges of corruption and extortion. The 33-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday during a sting operation after investigations by the Anti-Corruption Unit. It was alleged that the clerk, who dealt with police clearance certificates, earlier this month charged a member of the public an additional fee for a courier service of the documentation to Pretoria, said police spokesperson Andre Traut. "Corruption was not taken lightly and they would make every endeavour to ensure that the public was served by loyal and law-abiding police officials at all times," Traut said. A police clearance certificate is a document issued by the SAPS stating whether or not a person has committed a criminal offence. Members of the public are no longer expected to deliver their documentation to the Criminal Record Centre (CRC) in Pretoria as was previously the practice. It is now the sole responsibility of the SAPS to compile and deliver the form to the CRC on behalf of the applicant.
