Cape Town – In a “first of its kind” initiative by the International Ice Swimming Association (IISA), 15 swimmers will brave the icy Antarctica to swim 1km for charity and attempt to set a Guiness World Record. The swim, expected to take place this week when the weather is just right, will attempt to raise R50 000 for Madswimmer. South Africa will lead the way with four open-water swimmers, together with swimmers from nine countries, being Poland, Russia, Australia, Argentina, Italy, China, Bulgaria and Spain. All swimmers have qualified by at least one 1000m swim under 25 minutes in the past 2-3 years. Team South Africa comprises swimmers Jean Craven, founder of Madswimmer, Ram Barkai, founder of IISA, Samantha Whelpton, and Clinton Le Sueur. Madswimmer is a South African NPO that raises funds for children’s charities, and to date they have raised over R9 million with various world first swims they have done across the globe. A few people have swum the Antarctic before, but it has never been an official event. According to the IISA, they will identify a location in the open sea or a bay by the ship. “Each heat will be waiting at the ship in a warm location awaiting to be called. Coming heat will be wearing their swimming attire, a warm jacket, Bennie and slippers. "Once called the heat will make its way to start rubber duck. The swim will start in the water from a rubber duck as the start point. "Swimmers will be called to get ready and will have three calls. Take off your clothes. Enter the water. Start." The team reached their destination on Tuesday after two days of travelling in wild waters. For Madswimmer the Antarctica swim will be Part 1 of a dual series attempting ice swims at the extreme ends of the Earth - starting with this expedition at the South Pole and completing the series at the North Pole within the next year.
