Cape Town – Not content with having put the spotlight on the dangers that plastic poses to owls, penguins, turtles and the environment, a big-hearted young Claremont girl wants to spend her school holidays baking cookies for police officers and cleaning beaches. In May, the Cape Times highlighted Jenny Kenyon’s plastic collecting campaign. Asked yesterday how it was progressing, the now 5-year-old Jenny shyly said: “It’s going fine. We are also going to do a beach clean-up. “I’ve been making biscuits for my favourite police for Christmas. Other children can also recycle plastic and bring it to me,” she said. Jenny’s mother, Kath Kenyon, said: “Her project is still going strong, despite me having asked her if she wants to stop. “She said ‘no, Mommy, I still want to help the owls and the turtles and the penguins too’. “She was aiming to get 100m3 by Christmas, and we are already sitting on 105m3. “If she can do something so small that makes a difference (to the environment and quality of life of animals), then everybody else can,” said Kenyon The Owl Rescue Centre, for which Jenny collects the recycled plastic, picks up and transports it to its Hartebeespoort premises in Gauteng. Kenyon said Jenny’s 12-year-old brother Matthew had recently helped his boy scouts group hand over 49 Christmas parcels to the Little Brinks NPO. The organisation does emergency placements of abused and abandoned children. Jenny began collecting when she learnt at the Two Oceans Aquarium of a turtle that had eaten plastic. And her brother’s caring community activism had also been a source of inspiration for her, their mother said. Cape Times
