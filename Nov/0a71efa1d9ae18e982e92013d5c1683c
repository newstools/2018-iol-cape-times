Plato was joined at the “first” lights crossing in Adderley Street by some of the music artists who will perform at the free family-oriented event. They were also encouraged by some colourful costumed characters who turned up in support of the festivities. Yanga Sobetwa, the recently crowned the winner of Idols SA, will be performing at the event. Congratulating the 17-year-old from Delft on her win, Plato said: “Cape Town is rich with a diversity of talented young people, and one of them has been blossoming in front of the nation’s eyes over the last few months. “Yanga is the second Capetonian to win the singing competition, and for the second year running. “This proves, yet again, that Cape Town has an abundance of talent on offer.” Sobetwa said she wanted to use her music to inspire young people. This is in keeping with the theme of this year’s Festive Lights Switch-On, which is #BeInspiring. “I believe her win will provide motivation for many youngsters who have similar aspirations. “May she continue to serve as an encouragement to young people across the country, and I wish her well in her career,” said Plato. The line-up for the event includes DJ Eazy, Sarah Theron, Kunjalo, Kwesta and The Unknown Dance Crew. As in previous years, festival-goers are reminded that there will be stringent security measures in place at the event, and that the surrounding roads will be closed off for the build-up, during the event, and the morning after.
