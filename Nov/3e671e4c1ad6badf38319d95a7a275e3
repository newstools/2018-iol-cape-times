It is the most extreme, 24-hour mud obstacle challenge. South Africa's toughest mudders - Van Tonder, Carla van Huyssteen, Louis Smit and Trevor Lagerwey - qualified at the first South African Tough Mudder event in September. The four left for the US on November 5 and returned last week. Van Tonder came in 128th place. “I would definitely take over a pit crew for the next event and maybe change my training. The pit crew made a huge difference, especially at night when your hands are so cold you can't even work a zip. "Training-wise we are preparing ourselves for a 20km race, which is way off from a 160km race,” he said. Smit, based in Klerksdorp, did 80km in 20:44:29 and placed 137th overall and 89th in his age group out of 1 207 competitors.   “I learnt that I could keep going longer than I ever thought possible and definitely know now that I had placed some limits on myself that weren't close to my capacity. "Also I learnt that the mental state is 10 times more important in such a long race than the physical, and having the ability to flip negative into positive is a game-changing tool to have and kept me motivated all the time,” he said. Lagerwey, of Cape Town, was injured going into the race. “It was unfortunate that eight hours in I had to pull out due to a bad ankle sprain and calf damage. I managed 45km, which is by far the furthest I have ever run,” Lagerwey said. Van Huyssteen, who hails from Pietermaritzburg, managed to do five laps and about 45km until she had to stop due to injury. “The competition taught me that I prefer running in warm conditions; it was freezing and very difficult to keep going.”
