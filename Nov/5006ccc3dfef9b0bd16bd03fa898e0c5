They are from communities based in the south of Joburg. The camp will take six days, four of which will be spent on the island. While the foundation has conducted youth leadership camps on the island, it has promised this year will be different. AKF youth co-ordinator, Kabelo Kemp, said the young people were selected from several communities where they aimed to establish youth clubs. “These clubs will launch the Ahmed Kathrada centenary project, which culminates in 2029. “By then, we plan to have 100 youth clubs established as a tribute to the stalwart’s legacy. "The young people on this trip will not only receive training on how to be community youth activists, but will also conceptualise how they would like to see the youth clubs structured, and what types of issues the clubs should take up,” Kemp said. For the first time, the youth will be taken on a night tour of the prison cells, something very few people have experienced. Former prison warder Christo Brand will accompany them. Kemp said it would be the experience of a lifetime for the participants and, while the programme was intense, there would be time for fun. “As much as activism is about championing positive change, it should also be about building friendships across barriers,” she said.
