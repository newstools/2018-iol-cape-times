He faces a disciplinary hearing for alleged misconduct. Myers said the council charges were that he disclosed confidential admin-related information sometime in October 2017. He said it was not stated to whom he had allegedly disclosed the information. Myers said he was notified last week to attend a disciplinary hearing today. “It seems like there are forces out there that are desperate to see the back of me. I will attend the hearing on Wednesday. "This seems to have been hastily prepared. So it seems very much part of the ongoing vendetta against me,” he said. Knysna Municipality spokesperson Chumisa Kalawe said yesterday: “We can confirm that there is a council investigation into an alleged breach of the Code of Conduct for Councillors. The disciplinary committee is scheduled for tomorrow. ” Myers was booted out as deputy mayor when a majority of DA councillors voted in favour of a motion of no confidence in him last year. The party charged him and incumbent mayor Mark Willemse after they voted in favour of ANC motion of no confidence in former mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies earlier this year. Myers said it seemed “curious” that he received the notification about the council charges a day after a DA appeal panel exonerated him of any wrongdoing in an internal DA matter. DA provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said following the discussion of the party’s Federal Executive, a decision pertaining to Myers and Willemse would be communicated.
