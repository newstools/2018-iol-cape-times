The operation along the Atlantic Seaboard, which is one of several in the past week, netted 131 suspects. The City’s Traffic Services also issued 8 299 fines for various offences. Safety and Security Mayco member JP Smith said traffic officers were alerted to the hijacking of a Ford ST in Camps Bay on Sunday. “The vehicle was spotted in Sea Point and a high-speed chase ensued all the way to Salt River, where the suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot,” he said. The City's Metro Police Department also recovered two more stolen vehicles during their operations last week. “On November 14, officers recovered a stolen motorcycle at a vehicle checkpoint in Salt River and arrested two suspects, aged 36 and 48. On November 13, the Metro Police Camera Response Unit helped a tracking company recover a stolen panel van in Kuils River. A 23-year-old suspect was arrested in that incident,” said Smith. Of those arrested, 120 were motorists caught driving under the influence of alcohol at various roadblocks across the metropole. Staff Writer
