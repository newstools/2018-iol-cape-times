Cape Town – Another delay has come in the case against the trio accused of the murder of top advocate Pete Mihalik. The three men, Sizwe Biyela, 31, Nkosinathi Khumalo, 26, both from KwaZulu-Natal and Vuyile Maliti, 35, from Kuilsriver will appear in court again on December 13. Yesterday, Biyela, Khumalo and Maliti appeared briefly in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court, where they face charges of premeditated murder, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and possession of ammunition. According to National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila, Khumalo rejected a Legal Aid representative. “The court was advised that Judicare will only appoint a representative when the case goes to the high court. The Legal Aid SA legal representative was asked to represent accused Biyela and Khumalo, but Khumalo objected to this, saying he wants his own legal representative,” Ntabazalila said. Previously, the men were each remanded to different prisons as they faced a security risk at Pollsmoor prison, according to the State. On both previous appearances, Khumalo indicated that he would appoint his own lawyer, but had not yet done so. Maliti appointed Johannesburg-based lawyer Danny Kruger, while Biyela opted for Legal Aid. Biyela and Khumalo were arrested shortly after Mihalik was shot and killed while dropping his son at Reddam House School during October. Mihalik’s son was injured after a bullet lodged in his face. Biyela was remanded to Malmesbury prison, while Khumalo remains in custody at Allandale prison. Maliti was remanded to Drakenstein prison.
