Johannesburg - Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor's appearance at the state capture inquiry has been postponed as her legal team seeks more time. Mentor was due to return to the witness stand this week, but the commission's legal team have told commission chair Raymond Zondo that they need more time to investigate before she is allowed to appear. The former Parliament committee chair, who claimed Ajay Gupta offered her a ministerial post, will now appear at the commission on November 30 following Zondo granting the postponement. Zondo also granted a postponement to former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene who was due to appear before the inquiry this week. Nene's legal representative Advocate Adila Hassim said Nene would not be able to appear as he had broken his ankle. His doctor has since advised him not to travel. Hassim said Nene would be available to appear before the inquiry anytime after January 1. The commission will resume on Monday with the testimony of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan.
