The organisation said this was as the result of “gruesome attacks” that had occurred in the past few months and years. After two serious incidents in February and March, Tokai MTB stepped up security and has launched several initiatives to help lower the prevalence of criminal activity, as well as ensure that prompt action is taken when an emergency occurs in the park. In 2016, the group also launched an emergency contact number which saw a significant reduction in the response time to incidents in the area. Deon de Villiers, the Table Mountain National Park liaison of Tokai MTB, said although there were other emergency contact numbers already available, they were routed to a centralised call centre. “This often meant a big delay in dispatching a rescue team closest to the position from where the call came from, and with vital knowledge of the layout of the area. "Now with the support of SANParks honorary rangers, Tokai MTB conducts regular patrols of the park and its seven hot spots, not only on the weekend but during the week too,” said De Villiers. The group has also been working on a personal safety programme that aligns the City, SANParks and emergency response groups. “We have to keep the details of the technology we’ve helped test for the programme under wraps. But all tests so far have been highly successful in showing how we can further reduce the time between incident and alert, to get the message out to available first responders,” said De Villiers. As a non-profit organisation, all Tokai MTB’s work is voluntary and most of its resources are in the form of donations. Gnu World Media, a digital marketing firm, donated a Merida Big Seven 500 electric mountain bike to the organisation last week. It was converted into an e-bike by a local electric bike specialist and will be used for patrols. Anyone interested in supporting TokaiMTB’s work can contact Deon on trails@tokaimtb.co.za
