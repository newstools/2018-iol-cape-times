Cape Town – The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has labelled claims that a matric exam paper was leaked and that the exam would have to be rewritten as fake news. The department tweeted on Tuesday that the speculation was intended to sow confusion "Good morning! Please ignore all the rumours about exam paper rewrite. No paper has leaked, no papers will be rewritten. It’s all fake news designed to cause anxiety and confusion," the DBE tweet said. Earlier, a notice had been distributed among National Senior Certificate (NSC) candidates claiming that the biology exam paper had been stolen from the Western Cape Education Department. However, Western Cape MEC for Education Debbie Schafer dismissed the statement as false, tweeting: "(I have) just been told this is being distributed. It is false."      DBE spokesperson Troy Martens told News24: "We are not sure of the motives other than to cause confusion and add to the anxiety of learners. It's very disappointing." The DBE also confirmed that it was investigating a school in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, following allegations the principal assisted pupils with their geography paper. "The issue of the principal in Katlehong is true and is being dealt with by the department," she said.
