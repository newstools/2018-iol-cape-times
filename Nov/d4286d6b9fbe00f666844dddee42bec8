Hosted by the Universal Peace Federation (UPF) and the Royal House of Mandela, the event brought more than 1 000 dignitaries from around the world together, including current and former African heads of state. Speakers included Mandela’s eldest grandchild, Zwelivelile Mandela, Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete, and UPF co-founder, DrHak Ja Han Moon. Zwelivelile said his grandfather would forever remain an inspiration and a symbol, much like Cape Town’s natural wonder Table Mountain. “My grandfather was a colossal mountain among men. His life and legacy, like this mountain would continue to inspire us and stand as a symbol of what is best in us. “To stand firm for justice, to be relentless in the pursuit for peace and a champion of human dignity and a voice for the voiceless,” he said. Mbete said what she admired about the generation of leaders of Madiba’s time was that they were open-minded and considered the opinions of the younger cadres. Mbete recounted an interaction with Madiba where he spoke about deploying her on a diplomatic mission abroad. She declined and Mandela declared that she must deputise then Speaker of the National Assembly Frene Ginwala. Moon said the leadership that had gathered through the summit had done so to engage and realise together the path forward to lasting peace. She said when those in attendance reflected on the legacy of Mandela and how his vision of peace helped to birth the nation, all would be inspired.
