Simon's Town - The South African Navy said it was investigating the sinking of the decommissioned Tug De Mist in Simon’s Town Harbour on Saturday. The incident happened at around 5am after Navy members doing rounds in the harbour noticed that it had a slight list, tilted to one side. Navy divers were then called in and they arrived with equipment within the hour, the navy said in a statement. "Although they valiantly attempted to save the tug, the wind and sea conditions made it very difficult. The wind was blowing the tug onto its pneumatic fender, a large inflatable rubber that prevents a vessel bumping against the quay. "However due to the weight on the fender it burst, causing the tug’s gunwale, raised side of the vessel, to dip underwater. Tug De Mist was currently not operational and was up for disposal. She was 39 years old and was decommissioned two and half years ago. The navy said the last time the tug sailed was in June 2015 for the arrival of Tug Imvubu, one of the tugs that replaced her. "The navy is currently conducting salvage operations to retrieve Tug De Mist so that a proper investigation can be conducted to establish circumstances that led to the incident and a detailed statement will be issued on completion of the investigation," the navy concluded.
