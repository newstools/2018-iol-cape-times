Duncan, who studied graphic design at CPUT from 2004 to 2008, said she entered the competition to prove to herself and the deaf community that anything is possible. Not only did she succeed in winning the overall title, but she was also chosen as Mrs Deaf Personality 2018 and Mrs Deaf Charity 2018. Duncan, who grew up in Athlone, said: “I grew up in a close-knit family of leaders. They taught me to speak better, how to advocate for myself and to always go the extra mile in life to be on the same level as my hearing peers. “They always told me to be proudly deaf and overcome any obstacles thrown my way.” She received a cochlear implant a few years ago, and this has changed her life. “I am hearing sounds I’ve never heard before. It has made me a lot more confident in terms of knowing what I am actually hearing and being able to speak more clearly.” Duncan wants to see the MDSA (Miss, Mr, & Mrs Deaf South Africa) brand grow and says her responsibilities are to represent the brand, give workshops and raise funds. “I also have my very own platform to run. It is a national fitness campaign across South Africa.” She has the following message for deaf students: “The deaf can do anything but hear. This is exactly how you should see yourselves. "You can achieve anything in life if you put in the hard work, believe and trust in yourselves and always see the ability in your disability.”
