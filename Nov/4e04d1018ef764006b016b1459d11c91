Parow Park residents got a fright when a homeless man found a dead baby inside a wheelie bin. According to a resident, who asked not to be named, the baby girl was found lying between rubbish in a bin near Block 8 on Monday afternoon. “The bins are placed in a refuse spot and are normally locked, but some bins are left out for residents,” she says. “A homeless man was apparently looking for food when he saw the baby between the rubbish. The baby was put in some kind of paper and you could see the blood. We all got a skrik because nobody knows how the baby got there.” The resident explains the bins can be accessed by anyone passing through the City housing complex so they are unsure if someone “outside the complex” came to dump it. “Nobody saw who put it there and there is a lot of speculation if maybe someone from outside the complex dumped it there. Parow Park is open so someone could easily come in and dump it,” added the woman. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk confirmed the incident, saying: “A concealment of birth case has been registered at Parow police station and is currently under investigation after the body of a baby girl was found in a dirt bin at Parow Park at about 3pm. “No arrest (was made) as yet. A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death.” Daily Voice
