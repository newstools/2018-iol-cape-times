Made from PVC pipes and donated by DPI Plastics, the bins form part of a new retrieval project aimed at reducing the number of plastic sticks and straws on the country's beaches. The lolly-stick bins are made from high-density polyethylene and polypropylene polymers, and are being installed at selected Blue Flag beaches and other coastal areas around the country. Plastics SA sustainability manager John Kieser said the lolly bins were easily visible, with black and brightly coloured labels highlighting their usage. Kieser added that they've had great success with removing discarded fishing lines from beaches with the company's fishing-line bins. “These bins were installed at beaches along South Africa's coastline and encourage anglers to properly discard their fishing line instead of leaving it on the beach where it could entangle birds and sea life. “Building on the success of this project, close to 400 lolly bins are being installed at selected Blue Flag beaches, as well as other coastal areas throughout South Africa,” Kieser said. He urged the public to pick up the sticks lying on beaches and to throw them in the bins. Seadog Sport co-founder Simon Brooker said plastic sticks, such as earbuds, sucker/lollipops and straws, were among the biggest pollutants on the beaches. “If the material can be collected on a large scale, it can be recycled instead of ending on a landfill and in the environment as at present. "They can be used to create a wide range of products, such as non-food-grade packaging, rope, toys, piping, recycling bins and other household items,” added Brooker. Cape Times
