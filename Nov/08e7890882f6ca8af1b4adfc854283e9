This year’s annual endurance race will kick off on November 27 in Qunu, Eastern Cape, the hometown of late president Mandela. Nine teams, including land, running, log, signal, media, cycling and sea, are expected to arrive in Saldanha harbour on December 8. Students of the military academy have been planning, funding and taking part in Trans Enduro for more than 30 years. This year’s race is themed “Thuma mina” in response to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call for South Africans to “accept the call to selflessly serve the embattled nation”. The race is held to raise funds for the military academy’s Masiza community outreach programme, while the students are also involved in social impact projects along the way such as cleaning streets and neighbourhoods, painting school buildings and visiting retirement homes. The Masiza programme this year focuses on the Girl Child and early childhood development. Students collected sanitary products and will hand these out at certain schools along the way. While the cycling team covers a certain distance on bicycles, the sea team travels along the coast in two rubber dinghies, and the land team drives with vehicles from town to town collecting money, while the log team prepares for the other teams’ arrival. There is also a running team that covers a distance of 10km each day. At certain points the teams change. Lieutenant-Colonel Morné Boojens, chief military instructor at the academy, who is serving as mentor to participants, said: “The entire exercise is planned and executed by the academy students. “This develops their leadership skills and enhances their understanding of the practical issues related to community service. “In return, communities get exposed to the high calibre of the young men and women serving in defence of the country.”
