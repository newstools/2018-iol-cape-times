The latest incident involved the petrol-bombing of a bus in Milnerton on Wednesday. A 26-year-old man was arrested hours after the incident. It was not clear whether he was one of the former striking MyCiti employees. His two accomplices were yet to be arrested after they fled the scene. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of malicious damage to property was opened for investigation and the suspect was expected to appear in court once charged. Mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Felicity Purchase said: “At approximately 7.40pm, the man and two others boarded a MyCiTi bus at the Crassula bus stop along Koeberg Road. "They poured petrol in the interior of the bus and set it alight before fleeing the scene. The bus driver managed to escape unharmed,” she said. Four buses have been torched and another three have been damaged in similar attacks since October 15, when hundreds of employees of the Vehicle Operating Companies contracted to the city on the MyCiTi project started a unprotected strike demanding the city employ them directly. The former employees, including bus drivers and cleaners, claimed working conditions and benefits were not as good as those of those doing the same work but employed directly by the city. Cape Times
