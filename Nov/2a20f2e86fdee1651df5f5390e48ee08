Cape Town – The Cape Town Society for the Blind (CTSB) has raised about R200 000 during a mad hatters auction dinner. Hosted at the Italian Club in Cape Town, proceeds will go towards the upliftment projects run by the CTSB, Breede River Hospice, Little Angels Children’s Haven and the Maitland Cottage Children's Hospital. CTSB fund-raising manager Nicky Jacobs said: “The objective of the event was to raise money for CTSB and the three beneficiaries selected by the Freemasons of the Western Cape. We raised in excess of R200 000, which will be split 50% to CTSB and 50% split among the three organisations.” Jacobs said the funds would be used towards the training and upskilling of CTSB’s blind and visually impaired students. Guests were treated to live entertainment with the renowned auctioneer Joey Burke and author Lois Strachan. Strachan is the author of five books, a disability consultant and writer of the Beyond Sight blog. “Lois became blind at the age of 21 as a result of diabetes and quickly took the courageous decision to start moving forward with her life as a newly blind person living in a sighted world. "That decision has enabled her to succeed despite her blindness and to lead a life that is filled with diverse and exciting experiences.” For more information on the CTSB, visit them on Facebook or their website www.capetownsocietyfortheblind.co.za
