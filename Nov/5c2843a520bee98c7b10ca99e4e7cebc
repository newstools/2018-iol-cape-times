This comes just a week after the Hawks’ SA Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (Saneb) arrested another man where drugs worth R8.9 million were seized in Somerset West. Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said Saneb arrested the man on Tuesday and he could possibly be linked to last week’s arrest for a drug storage facility. “Following a multidisciplinary operation by a team that included Saneb and Crime Intelligence, Mogamat Rafiek Hayners, 24, was arrested after he was found at the storage facility. ‘‘Hayners was charged for dealing in drugs and possession of an illegal firearm. “The case against Hayners was on November 15 postponed by the Somerset West Magistrate’s Court for formal bail application to be heard (today), while he remains in custody,” Nkwalase said. Meanwhile, Phillipus Coenraad Swart, 33, appeared at the George Magistrate’s Court last Friday, facing charges of dealing in Cannabis. “(At) his arrest, a total of over R10 000 worth of dagga was found on his possession. ‘‘This followed a waylay investigation conducted after Swart apparently placed a drug sale advertisement on social media.” Chevon Booysen
