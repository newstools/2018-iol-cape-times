Cape Town â€“ A 33-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday after he robbed taxi passengers at gunpoint in Mitchells Plain. Metro police officers on patrol in Tafelsig were flagged down by a taxi driver who informed them that two men had robbed his passengers, the City of Cape Town said. Metro police spokesperson Ruth Solomons said the suspect was arrested on charges of armed robbery, possession of suspected stolen property and the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. "Armed with a description of the suspects and the direction they were last seen headed, officers took off and tracked them down soon enough. "After a short chase, officers caught one of the suspects and found him in possession of a 9mm pistol and six rounds of ammunition. He also had a cellphone on him, which was suspected to be stolen." Last week, taxi drivers overpowered an alleged robber who held a fellow driver at gunpoint in Lotus River. The 24-year-old demanded cash from the taxi driver, on which he drove to fellow taxi drivers, who managed to overpower the suspect and retrieve the firearm.
