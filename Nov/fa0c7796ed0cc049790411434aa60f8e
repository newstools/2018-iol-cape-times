Johannesburg - IOL's #WeRemember campaign won Best in Social Media Engagement at the WAN-IFRA 2018 African Digital Media Awards in Johannesburg on Friday night. The campaign, which ran during Women's Month, honoured victims of gender-based violence by telling the stories of 31 women who had been murdered, many of them by their intimate partners. "We wanted these women to be more than today's headline, or a statistic to be trotted out when it is time to report on the fight against crime. They were women with hopes and dreams and they need to be remembered," said IOL editor Riana Howa. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
