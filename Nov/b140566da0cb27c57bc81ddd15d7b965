Cape Town -  Mortimer Saunders has been found guilty of of premeditated murder and rape of 3-year-old Courtney Pieters at the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday. Judge Babalwa Mantame said in her analysis that the crimes Saunders  committed were the “most vicious, vile, ruthless and evil murder the court has ever seen.” Mantame said she rejected Saunders’ version of events as given in his plea admission at the beginning of his trial. “The accused intended to kill the deceased. It did not happen on the spur of the moment as submitted by the defence. (Saunders) waited for the opportune time to commit the crime when there was no adult supervision at home. He threatened the deceased with violence when he choked her and hit her,” she said. Mantame further added that Courtney  suffered a “painful, agonising death and it appeared that the child went through a lot of torture before her death”. Courtney went missing from her Pluto Street home in Salberau, Elsies River on May 4 last year. Mantame said the State relied on circumstantial evidence and proved their case “beyond reasonable doubt”. Mantame said: “Rape is the most shameful and disempowering act (and perpetrating this) on babies and children deprives them of being children. In most instances, these crimes are committed by those close to the victim. The accused misused his position of trust. “The deceased was a defenseless child who died a slow, torturous death.” The defence asked for a postponement to draw up pre-sentencing reports. The State indicated they would argue in aggravation of sentence in terms of the “victim impact report”. Mantame postponed the matter to December 4.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
