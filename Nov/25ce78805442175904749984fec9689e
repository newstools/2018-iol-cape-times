He was diagnosed with stage 3b lung cancer. With about 20 years in the industry, Ward started young, on the graveyard shift on UCT Radio, before moving to Good Hope FM and Heart FM. Through the Blouberg Development Foundation NPC, Ward founded One FM 94.0, a non-profit community radio station and platform for seasoned and upcoming radio presenters in Cape Town. Five years ago, Ward received the news that he had colon cancer. He underwent surgery and extensive chemotherapy. During a routine check-up last month, the pathology indicated a rise in his cancer markers. Concerned, doctors sent him for an MRI, where they discovered a tumour in his heart and right lung. A bronchoscopy found that Ward had stage 3b non-small cell lung cancer. Without medical aid, Ward is forced to take on medical bills to cover the expensive cost of chemotherapy and radiation, estimated to cost approximately R150 000. His close friend, Candace Orme, 39, set up a campaign on donation-based crowdfunding platform BackaBuddy, to appeal to the public to help support Ian and his family. The campaign has thus far raised R25 794.91. “We hope to alleviate some of his financial constraints so he can focus on getting better,” said Orme. With the funds raised, Orme also hopes to cover some of Ward’s monthly expenses as he is the sole provider for his family. “Ian has given so much of himself to better our community, now we have the opportunity to support him in his time of need,” said BackaBuddy public relations officer Zane Groenewald, .
