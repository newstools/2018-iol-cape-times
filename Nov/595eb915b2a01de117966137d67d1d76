The handover took place last Friday with a team from the Jet store in Wynberg and Jet’s Urshela Schutte (head of CSI), Brad Martin (divisional operations manager) and Arlene Rielly-Spence (senior human resource business partner). Christel House provides no-fee scholarships, various support services as well as full school uniforms to each of its 750 students who come from some of Cape Town’s disadvantaged communities. Established in 1998, Christel House is an international charity organisation with a mission to break the cycle of poverty. It operates eight learning centres globally of which its school in Ottery is the only one in Africa. The school enrols 750 pupils from Grades R to 12 annually and supports more than 250 school leavers up to five years post matric. Jerry Anthonyrajah, divisional executive strategy and marketing at Jet, said: “Jet is delighted to be part of this opportunity to uplift and improve the lives of students; our future leaders. “This is in line with Jet’s core values to empower the communities it serves.” As a thank you from the school, the students sang various songs and one of the Grade 3 learners presented Jet with a special certificate of appreciation for the store’s kind support.
