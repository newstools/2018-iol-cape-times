They were found balancing on the upturned hull of the vessel in gale-force winds at 6.49pm, but were are all wearing life jackets, the NSRI said in a statement. They were brought back to the NSRI rescue base at the V&A Waterfront. The three crew members were all treated for hypothermia and two were treated for "non-life threatening injuries". They were transported to hospital by an ER24 ambulance. The five tourists – three females and two males – were also transported to hospital as a precaution, having sustained mild hypothermia.
