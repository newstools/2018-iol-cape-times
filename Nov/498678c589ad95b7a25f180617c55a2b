Police say Zamxaka and Mabinza appeared in the Bellville Magistrate's Court on Friday and were positively connected to co-accused Siyabonga Tofi, 30-year-old Anele Rongo and 41-year-old Mzolisi Tshuku, arrested on June 12 concerning the same robbery. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said that due to good detective work, the long arm of the law caught up with the perpetrators of the business robbery that occurred approximately a year ago. Two of the alleged perpetrators gained entry to the company plant by using access cards. These cards serve as clock cards and to activate the turnstile at the gate. They went into the security office and instructed the security on duty to stay inside. All the staff who were making their way towards the exit gate were detained and instructed by the perpetrators to go into the kitchen which is next to the security office, Van Wyk said. He said shortly thereafter two other suspects accessed the company plant, also using access cards, and walked towards the bank's employees. The bank employees were instructed to open the safe and an undisclosed amount of cash and banking equipment were taken. Cape Times
