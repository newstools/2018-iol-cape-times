Their words exactly. (My youngest daughter does not have the same surname as she is from my second marriage.) Reasons cited that diversity had to take precedence over family. I appealed to Mr Downard of the school’s governing body as my older daughters have been good students and I wanted my last daughter to share the same upbringing with regards to schooling. However, Mr Downard’s SGB refused her a place. Because I attached a copy of my ID (but not certified) to the application they said it was incomplete. In my opinion, Mrs Cook, the school secretary, takes it upon herself to play God with the applications. Karyn Romero Cape Town
