The Survé Philanthropies, the private foundation which houses several of the Survé family’s philanthropic initiatives, announced the launch of the Imagine Awards earlier this month. “People continue to do good work for the greater good in spite of desperate times, and despite cuts in funding from donors. “However, they are often not honoured for the work they do. At the Imagine Awards, we will recognise those who work tirelessly to put the needs of others above their own. If we support and celebrate those who diligently work to make a difference, it all adds up,” said the director of Survé Philanthropies, Saarah Survé. Organisers say the quality of the nominations was very high. Nearly 100 nominations were received from across the country. Of these, 33 individuals and organisations made it to the short list in various categories including arts and culture; disability; technology; human rights; media; education; women; children and poverty alleviation. Twelve special awards will also be conferred on individuals who have made a contribution to social justice. The recipients of the Imagine Awards will also be assisted with funding towards their respective initiatives. The event will be attended by about 1 500 people including representatives from civil society organisations, national and local government officials, members of the public, diplomats, international philanthropists, captains of industry, community leaders and business figures. The line-up for tomorrow’s event includes the Rosa Choir, Kronendal Music Academy, Dizo Plaatjies and his band, Sammy Webber, the Sekunjalo Edujazz Band and the Lady Day Big Band. Artscape will also use the opportunity to show off its recently-renovated interior.
