In her feature, Waxa detailed the story of Philippi mother Lizeka Ncede, 43, whose health deteriorated after her son, Bongile Ncede, was shot outside his home by unknown assailants in the Mesiya informal settlement. Bongile, 23, was paralysed from the waist down and relied on his mother for assistance. On her award last night, Waxa said: “I am happy that I won. It was one of the saddest stories I ever covered seeing a young man lying in bed helplessly was sad. "What made me happy the most was that after the story was published, Bongile’s life changed. As photographers our role is to change people’s lives through our stories.” Cape Times editor Aneez Salie hailed Waxa, saying: “We are absolutely thrilled that Cindy has won this award, it’s richly deserved. She is a very hard-working photographer, with a very keen social conscience.”
