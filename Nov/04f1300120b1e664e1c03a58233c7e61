They all appeared in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court yesterday. The suspects, of which one is said to be notorious gang leader Rudi Lakay, face more than 180 charges under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act relating to drug dealing. Lakay, Ike Collins, Jonathan Hermanus, Christiaan Green, Dwaine Rhode, Quintus Booysen, Alneiro Isaks, Mario de Wee, Mark de Wee, Eben George, Dylon Lakay, Liaan Erasmus, Shamier Khan and Llewellyn Bostander will spend Christmas behind bars before they can apply for bail next year. One of the recently arrested suspects handed himself over to police on November 22, the same day another was arrested in connection with the same case. The third suspect was arrested the day before on November 21. The case was postponed to February 5 for bail applications and set down for a week. Previously, police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the men were arrested during a takedown operation. “A multidisciplinary team consisting of various SAPS units successfully executed a takedown operation, when suspected gang members were arrested. The suspects were arrested at Victoria and La Paloma Flats in Kuilsriver,” Van Wyk said. The Transportation Board, Sars, and the Asset Forfeiture Unit form part of the investigation, which is guided by a dedicated prosecutor from the National Prosecuting Authority. Lakay, the first accused in the matter, operates a transport fleet business. “During the raid, six suspected drug dens were visited and a substantial amount of cash, two hard drives and six cellphones were seized,” Van Wyk said. Police provincial commissioner Khombinkosi Jula hailed the efforts of the officers for executing the arrests and restoring trust in the SAPS. His sentiments were echoed by Major-General Andre Lincoln, who said the arrests came as a result of a three-year intensive investigation where it is believed Lakay used his transport business as a ruse to transport drugs.
