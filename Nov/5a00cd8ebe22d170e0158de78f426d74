On Wednesday, a second suspect was arrested in connection with a R8.9 million drug bust in Somerset West last week. The 45-year-old suspect is believed to be the lessee of the storage facility in Somerset West Business Park where large quantities of tik, heroin and mandrax were found by investigators from the Hawks Narcotics Enforcement Bureau and police crime intelligence. Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said the suspect had handed herself over to police after they discovered she was renting the storage unit where the narcotics were discovered.
