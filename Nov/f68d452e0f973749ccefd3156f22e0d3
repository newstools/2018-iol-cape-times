Cape Town – International animal welfare foundation Four Paws has joined the #GivingTuesday movement and hopes to raise funds to build a home for two lions who survived a veld fire earlier this year and who were subsequently rescued. The majestical Juba and Micca, who were kept as “security guards” on a South African farm, now live a species-appropriate life at Lionsrock Big Cat Sanctuary in Bethlehem in the Free State. The duo need a big Christmas gift this year - an enclosure where they can roam. “These wonderful lions almost lost their lives in a horrible way,” said Four Paws South Africa Country Director Fiona Miles. “Now, they are enjoying life at a true sanctuary where they can live life as they were meant to. “However, they’ve been staying in a temporary enclosure. “It is indeed a happy ending that we could have rescued them from their circumstances, but we want to give them the big enclosure they deserve and that comes at a price,” she said. Miles said the two escaped the claws of death by chance, something that rarely happened when disaster struck. Images of the enclosures they were kept in showed the extent of the fire. “We now have a wonderful opportunity to give these survivors a second chance at living life like they were meant to. By opening our hearts and donating towards building an enclosure for them, we can continue to build on their story together,” Miles said. “We as an organisation expose animal cruelty and rescue these animals from the horrible conditions they were dealt. It is now up to us to protect them for the rest of our lives. "Donating towards the enclosure of Juba and Micca will provide them with the lifelong protection they need.” Visit https://www.givengain.com/cc/jubamiccarescue/ for more.
