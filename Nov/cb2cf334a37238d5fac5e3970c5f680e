Cape Town – The owner of a Cape Flats drug rehabilitation centre, who admitted to assaulting two self-confessed thieves who stole from him, will now face charges of attempted murder. Police confirmed Rashaad Allen, who runs the Foundation for Positive Change in Parkwood, was arrested on Tuesday afternoon after the two thieves laid charges against him. Allen admitted to beating up the two men, who had been receiving free treatment at the rehab, last Tuesday after they stole a laptop, modem, microphones, a silver chain and two rings. They then tried to sell the stolen goods at Cash Converters in Ottery. Rashaad said: “I went to hand myself over at the police station that same evening. I told the police what happened, how they broke in and stole my stuff. “I told them I went to fetch them and donnered them. The police said they were not aware of the matter. They told me to go home.” They had been at the rehab centre for four weeks and two weeks respectively. Abrahams said when they tried to sell the items, the store manager called Rashaad after his name had popped up on the laptop. He said Allen took them to the centre where he and several other men tied them up and beat them for four hours. They were also burnt with cigarettes but managed to escape by untying the ropes. They were taken to hospital by family and friends. An unrepentant Rashaad said the young men had bitten the hand that fed them. “I have come out of jail to help others and these boys repay me by stealing from our organisation. I am bitterly disappointed,” he said on Monday. He was picked up by police just after 2pm on Tuesday. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirms: “Please be advised that a 47-year-old man was arrested this afternoon. Once he has been charged he is expected to appear in court where he is facing charges of attempted murder.”
