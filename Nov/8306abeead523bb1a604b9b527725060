Several big parties and festivals are being planned across the country to mark the end of their school careers. Charnel Hattingh, national marketing and communications manager at Fidelity ADT, has offered safety tips for matriculants who will be celebrating away from home in a possibly unfamiliar area. Before leaving your accommodation for the day or night, ensure that anything valuable is locked away in a drawer or safe. Never carry large amounts of cash or go out wearing flashy or expensive jewellery. If your accommodation is a holiday house or apartment, make sure all the doors are locked, the windows are properly shut and that the alarm is activated if a system is installed. When out at different events and activities, be aware of your surroundings and arrange with your friends to keep an eye on one another and your belongings. If you are approached by a suspicious individual, walk away and report it to the closest security person or to the police. Do not accept drinks from strangers and do not leave your drinks unattended. Spiking of drinks is still rife. When it is time to return to your accommodation after a night out: Never leave without your friends. Do not accept a lift from a stranger; rather use transport provided by the event organisers. Driving after a few drinks is never an option. Call a cab or use event shuttles if they are available instead. Consider appointing a designated driver or someone who agrees not to drink and will be responsible for getting everyone home safely.
