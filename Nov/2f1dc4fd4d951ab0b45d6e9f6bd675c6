Cape Town – It's been a magical year for Khayelitsha magician Sesona Gagana, who has been awarded the Siegfried and Roy Foundation Scholarship at the College of Magic. Sesona, 15, recently returned from representing South Africa’s youth on an educational tour to Las Vegas and New York, where he met Siegfried. The teen illusionist absorbs everything he can about close-up magic, stage magic, juggling, mime and clowning. “Magic has transformed my life so much this year. Travelling overseas for the first time and meeting my magical heroes was a dream come true and now I’ve been awarded this scholarship,” Sesona said. The college, a non-profit organisation that aims to create social empowerment, teaches the art of magic and its allied arts, as well as life skills, to children and adults. Six students from the College of Magic went on the trip to the US, which included Liam Hewitson, 15, from Bergvliet, Emma Hutchison, 16, from Claremont, Sahil Samlal, 16, from Century City, Duncan Shelver, 16, from Bellville, and Anela Gazi, 18, from Mfuleni. The teens met distinguished magicians, including Penn & Teller, David Copperfield and Terry Fator.
