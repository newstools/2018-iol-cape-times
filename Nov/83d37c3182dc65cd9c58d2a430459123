Cape Town - Scores were evacuated after a blaze broke out at tourist attraction V&A Waterfront in Cape Town. According to a source at the scene, loudspeakers ordered shoppers and tourists to leave the premises, repeating "This is an emergency". A huge cloud of black smoke could be seen covering the building's main entrance and nearly reaching the Breakwater parking. "Please note that there was a fire in the basement parking at Vic Warf and shoppers have been evacuated. No injuries. Fire officials are on the scene," read a message posted on the V&A Waterfront's Facebook page City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue Spokesperson Theo Layne later confirmed that an electrical transformer caught alight, resulting in the fire. "The City's fire and rescue service responded to the V&A Waterfront at 18:03 this evening. The fire was in the basement of the Pick n Pay centre and no evacuations were required," said Layne. The fire has been contained but there are still two fire engines and one rescue vehicle on the scene, Layne said. * Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535.
