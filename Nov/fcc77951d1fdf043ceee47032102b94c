Cape Town – A woman allegedly involved in the murder of a Cape Town policeman just over a year ago has been tracked down about 950km away, police said on Friday. After police recently issued a notice asking the public for any information about her whereabouts, thanks to media coverage and information received from the community, the woman has been found, police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said, News24 reported. A Western Cape tracking team arrested her in Mbombo Village, Ntabakulu, in the Eastern Cape at about 6.30pm on Thursday. She is expected to appear in the Athlone Magistrate's Court on Monday on a charge of murder. Constable Mneli Jobela was found inside his vehicle in Oliver Tambo Drive, Samora Machel, on October 6 last year. He had been shot in the back of his head. Although it was alleged that three people were involved in his murder, only two people were arrested. A warrant of arrest was issued for the third suspect – a 32-year-old woman.
