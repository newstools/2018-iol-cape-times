At the end of this month the festival will welcome residents from all walks of life, and even those from outside the Western Cape, to celebrate. From November 30 until December 2, Westridge Gardens in Mitchells Plain will be transformed into Cape Town’s home of peace, love and unity. The more than 40 000 people expected will be entertained by international artists such as Sybil and Judy Boucher. Founder and director of the festival Rozario Brown said: “One of the reasons the event is so successful is because there are no alcohol sales and no alcohol is allowed inside the venue. “It’s a ‘dry event’ but there is nothing dry about the actual festival! “We have a stellar line-up of entertainment. About 60% of the artists come from this community, and many major local artists will join the line-up, including Vernon Castle, Salomé and Camillo Lombard. “This festival aims to celebrate progress being made and positivity coming out of our forgotten communities. “It is about creating a platform to bring the people together - people not only from Mitchells Plain, but from across the Western Cape,” he said. Brown said they were particularly excited about the “massive air and biker shows” added to this year’s event. Also, the festival adopted Heinz Park Primary School four years ago and sponsors its annual Grade 7 prom. “The main objective of this prom is to encourage learners to remain at school and have something to work towards. ‘‘We are aiming to heighten awareness around the importance of these kids having a decent education.” The event will be free to pensioners, children under the age of 6 and people with disabilities. Entry for children 13 and over will be R50, while children aged 6 to 12 will pay R30 on November 30 and December 1. Children under 6 will still enter free on December 2, while children aged 6 to 12 and pensioners will pay R60. General access for people aged 13 and over will cost R150.
