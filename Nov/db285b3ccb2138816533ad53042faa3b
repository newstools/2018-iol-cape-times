Cape Town – A Grade 9 pupil has allegedly been stabbed by fellow pupils at the Voorbrug High School in Delft. Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Jessica Shelver said on Friday the 16-year-old boy was stabbed twice in the neck and is in a critical condition in hospital, the SABC reported. “The alleged perpetrators are reportedly in police custody. The teachers and the learners at the school are severely traumatised and a psychologist is currently at the school providing counselling. "We've also arranged that our employee wellness programme conducts a debriefing session with teachers this afternoon. There are two alleged perpetrators involved in the incident and both are in Grade 9,” Shelver said. In October last year, a Grade 9 pupil was stabbed to death with a knife by a fellow pupil in the same grade at Leiden High school in Delft. Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said at the time this was part of the ongoing gang-related activities that are prevalent in the area and affecting the school.
