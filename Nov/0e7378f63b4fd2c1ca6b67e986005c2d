The 24-year-old was arrested and faces charges of kidnapping, possession of an unlicensed firearm, and possession of ammunition and a prohibited firearm. “On Monday, at about 4.30am, the complainant, a taxi driver, was threatened by an armed, unknown male, while driving down Buck Road, Lotus River, Grassy Park. "The suspect demanded cash from the complainant, whereafter the complainant drove to his fellow taxi drivers and they managed to overpower the suspect and retrieve the firearm. "The suspect, aged 24, with the firearm, a 9mm, 11 rounds, one magazine, serial number filed off, was handed over to SAPS Grassy Park,” said police spokesperson FC Van Wyk. While Grassy Park Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Phillip Bam lauded police and the taxi drivers for the quick arrest, he said guns on the streets were a big problem. “We need the guns off the street. We are appealing to police to check suspicious people. "Last week, also in Buck Road, we found a 16-year-old with a loaded firearm. We'd like the community to please report guns in the area to the police. If you not comfortable going to the station, call crime stop, report where we can find guns,” said Bam. Anyone with information on crime in the Grassy Park area can anonymously call the police at 021 700 3940 or Crime Stop at 08600 10111.
