Cape Town â€“ The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) will approach the Electoral Court to postpone a by-election scheduled for this Wednesday in Ward 9 in the Witzenberg Municipality in the Western Cape. The IEC said in a statement the decision follows complaints from political parties that they had not received reasonable access to potential voters for campaigning purposes, the SABC reported. Ward 9 is situated in a far-off rural area at the top of the Great Winterhoek mountains near Porterville. The IEC said it would ask the Electoral Court for time to resolve the complaints and ensure sufficient opportunity for all parties to campaign. Last week, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) opened a case against a farmer in the ward for allegedly preventing them from getting access to his farm where two voting stations are situated. The ward was previously represented by the ANC and became vacant as a result of the resignation of the councillor.
