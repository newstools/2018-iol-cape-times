The property developer purchased the site in March last year and plans were approved for the development of 56 residential units. Movement chairperson Adnaan Oesman said they had made recommendations to the developer when it had applied for its first interdict against residents disrupting the construction site. Yesterday, Oesman said some of their suggestions had been adopted. These included a reduction in the size and height of the Lion Street Development, and an amendment to its façade, in keeping with the aesthetic of the Grade 1 heritage site. Another concession was an increased parking ratio to ensure fewer cars are parked on the street. Oesman said construction in the residential neighbourhood was now limited to certain times, with cleaning services to ensure the site was kept tidy. Following a commitment by the community to stay calm, armed security has been removed from the sites. “Bo-Kaap Youth Movement remains committed to finding peaceful, positive solutions that generate opportunities for our community and safeguard their future,” Oesman said. The organisation is developing a Community Benefit Agreement and is seeking input from residents on submitting nominations for the declaration of the Auwal Masjid and Tana Baru as national heritage sites, to protect, recognise and celebrate the first Masjid and the historic cemetery. Blok managing director Jacques van Embden said: “The changes have already been incorporated into the revised scheme with reduced overall building size, amendment to the design of the Lion Street facade and increased parking ratio for the building. "Some of the work has already happened on site as per the new design or has been submitted to council.” Cape Times
