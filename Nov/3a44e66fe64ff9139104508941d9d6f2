The demonstration comes after the vehicle operating companies (VOCs) dismissed their employees who were part of an unprotected strike after their failure to attend disciplinary hearings. Protesters staged a sit-in yesterday, demanding a meeting with Mayor Dan Plato, who they said failed to respond to them despite promising to do so.     Police and law enforcement officers used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters. About five people were arrested and later released. City spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said: “All law enforcement agencies, led by SAPS Public Order Police, were in attendance and monitored the situation. "The City can confirm that the protesters were removed from the Civic Centre. The building still remains in partial lockdown to ensure the safety of employees. The situation is calm.” Three MyCiTi buses had been burnt since the start of the strike and three others damaged. The City said the damage would cost an estimated R13million, “a loss the City can ill- afford.” MyCiTi bus operating company Kidrogen axed 40% of its drivers last Friday after they failed to attend disciplinary hearings after being issued with notices. The company said those who returned to work received written warnings following due process in terms of the Labour Relations Act. The former workers had downed tools nearly a month ago, demanding that the City employ them directly. They claimed their working conditions and benefits were not as good as those of those doing the same work but employed directly by the City. Mayco member for transport and urban development Felicity Purchase said the City could not employ the workers directly and VOCs and the station management contractor were in the process of recruiting new staff. In its attempt to have the service fully restored, the City had turned to the SA Road Passenger Bargaining Council’s National Bargaining Forum to intervene in the dispute. Purchase said, unfortunately, the talks had not resolved the impasse.
