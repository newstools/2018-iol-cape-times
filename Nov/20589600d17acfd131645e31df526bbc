From noon until 3pm at Die Damhuis in Melkbosstrand, the chocolate tri-colour long-coat chihuahua who continues to inspire the nation will celebrate his birthday, along with six VVIP doggies of social media, the media and sponsors. Apart from celebrating his birthday, Mr Miyagee will be handing over 500kg of Hills Pet food to Cape Daschund Rescue. VIP doggies will receive “pamper sessions” by Pet Wellness Worx specialist Lorren Barham and a specialised goody bag in true VIP style, containing the things Mr Miyagee loves best. Mr Miyagee is the ambassador of Pet Mall SA’s pay-it-forward initiative, the Dare 2 Care Campaign. He is a certified emotional support pet to an 8-year-old boy and a trained therapy dog. He is also a well known and loved public figure as an advocate against bullying in schools and animal abuse - and visits schools, hospitals, special needs homes, old-age homes and children’s homes to inspire those there. Mr Miyagee adores children and most of the time will rest his head on someone’s lap or sit next to a sick patient, watching over them. In his free time, he enjoys participating in dog shows, acting in front of cameras, posing as a model for various brands and campaigns, and doing reviews as a pet food, nutrition, wellness, toy and accessory blogger. The Dare 2 Care team will be travelling to the Netherlands next year to spread its wings internationally. To name but a few of his assigned duties, Miyagee is the face of Italian Gelato Ice Bau ice cream for dogs, is an ambassador for Shuttermutts Pet Photography, and has been named as one of the most influential pets with more than 10 000 followers.
