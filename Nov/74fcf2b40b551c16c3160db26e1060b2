November is the deadline for obtaining the new Sassa cards and there will be no extension, said the agency. Anyone who doesn't swop won't be able to get their January 2019 social grants. Sassa said just over half a million out of a total of about 10.9 million beneficiaries were still in possession of the old cards. Sassa acting chief executive Abraham Mahlangu said: â€œWe urge all remaining beneficiaries of social grants who are still in possession of the old Sassa card to urgently swop them for the new gold Sassa card. Beneficiaries are also urged to ignore tempting SMS and WhatsApp messages claiming that Sassa and some retailers were offering vouchers for unemployed people.
