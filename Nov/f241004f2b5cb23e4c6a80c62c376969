Cape Town – A 33-year-old woman found herself on the wrong side of the law when she was arrested in possession of a stolen vehicle in Khayelitsha. Officers on patrol spotted a Hyundai i10 at a four-way stop without a number plate last week. The vehicle was pulled over, but the driver and another passenger bolted, leaving behind a female passenger. “A check on the vehicle confirmed it had been stolen in Brackenfell. The 33-year-old woman was arrested on a charge of possession of a stolen vehicle and detained,” said the City. In September, a 30-year-old man was arrested following a chase along Kromboom Road in Lansdowne. The Flying Squad gave chase after a stolen car was spotted in the area. The car had been hijacked in Diep River in August. Police blocked the vehicle when it attempted to flee and it collided with another vehicle. Though shots were fired, there were no injuries.
