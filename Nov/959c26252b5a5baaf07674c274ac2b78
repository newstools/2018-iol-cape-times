Strandfontein resident and sales agent Joy Willenberg, 31, took the top spot at the Blackball International World Pool Championships held this week in Bridlington, UK. Willenberg said: “When I saw my name at the top spot, I did not want to believe it, and I thought to myself there must still be others playing and my ranking would change. “But then I was announced the winner in the women’s singles category and I was still in disbelief.” Willenberg left along with the South African team on November 17. The team walked away with a silver medal after their final came down to sudden death, she said. “It was a very tough competition and took a lot of hard work and preparation. When we got there we had to adjust to their tables and the weather. "Our intention was to bring the gold home as a team, but we are still very happy with our accomplishment as runners-up to France. In various other categories we managed to get gold, silver and bronze medals.” Earlier this year, Willenberg won the classics round at the SA Snooker Championships in Lansdowne. She said she intends to participate in a few more competitions before the end of the year.
