Cape Town – According to the Local Government Department, the collective water levels of dams feeding Cape Town dropped from 72.4% last week to 71.3% this week. Four of the province's six major dams are still above 70% and the overall dam levels still sit at just below double what it was in 2017. In mid-September, Cape Town's dam levels hit the 70% mark for the first time since 2015. Local Government Minister Anton Bredell said major dams in the province are declining by about 1 percent weekly. Bredell has appealed to consumers to continue to use water sparingly during summer. The Theewaterskloof Dam near Villiersdorp is currently 55 percent full, while the Voëlvlei stands at 91 percent and the Berg River Dam at 96 percent.
