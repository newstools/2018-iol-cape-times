The NSRI spokesperson was awarded the Chevalier de Ordre du Mérite Maritime (Knight in the Order of Maritime Merit) award in the presence of French ambassador to South Africa, Christophe Farnaud, on Monday. The French insignia of Chevalier de l’Ordre du Mérite Maritime celebrates the accomplishments of distinguished individuals in the marine environment, irrespective of sex, social background or nationality. The award comes in recognition of his work at the NSRI since 1993, in particular his role in the welfare of French citizens who have been rescued and helped while visiting South Africa. “It is an honour for me and the NSRI, as well as all the associated organisations, to be recognised and to reflect on the support we get from the French Consulate. Being a volunteer for the NSRI is a real honour,” Lambinon said. Lambinon has served at Station 8 Hout Bay and at Station 2 Bakoven as a volunteer crewman since 1993, and at Station 29 Air Sea Rescue unit as a volunteer rescue swimmer. He was also awarded the NSRI Directors Letter of Thanks for his role in the rescue of a Japanese Solo Sailor in 2001, whose yacht was swept ashore near Cape Point. Acting NSRI chief executive Mark Hughes said: “Craig is a unique individual who manages to balance his technical knowledge and efficiency with sincere compassion. “He frequently works on multiple rescues at any one time, and he never seems to sleep. Craig is a deserving recipient of this honour.”
