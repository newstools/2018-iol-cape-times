NSRI Port Edward station commander John Nicholas said that at about 11.50am yesterday they responded to reports of a drowning in progress at Kidd's Beach in Leisure Bay. “On arrival on the scene a search commenced for a local 12-year-old male child missing in the surf," Nicholas said. "It appears that bystanders using a body board had reached the child in the surf, but they were unable to secure the child before the surf then swept the child away from them. "They were forced to return to shore. Police search and rescue will continue in an ongoing search operation and family of the child are being supported by the South African Police Service,” he said. An investigation is under way to determine what had happened, he added. Cape Times
