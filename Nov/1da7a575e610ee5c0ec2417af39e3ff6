SANParks, together with the Knysna Municipality, have approached Mark Williams of Watermark Marine to develop the cargo net for the Knysna estuary channels. The first test started last week when it was placed in a channel leading to the Ashmead channel. The results of the second test which was withstanding yesterday’s rain will indicate if a green light must be given to five more channels. Knysna area manager Megan Taplin said: “The net will supplement efforts by various teams from SANParks and the Knysna Municipality to protect South Africa’s number one estuary in terms of biodiversity significance.” There is a team consisting of 22 people working from Monday to Friday, cleaning up litter around the estuary as well as the five main culverts draining from the CBD areas to the estuary. SANParks spokesperson Nandi Mgwadlamba said about 130 people were employed in the last contract which ended in July 2017. “This figure will increase in the next financial year starting in April 2019,” Mgwadlamba said. SANParks Honorary Rangers also organise weekly litter clean-ups of the estuary with volunteers. Citizens are welcome to join these regular clean-up efforts and be privy to records of litter collected daily,” she said. Staff Writer
