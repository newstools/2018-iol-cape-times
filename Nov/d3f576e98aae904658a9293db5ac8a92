He hopes to raise R48 000 to fund a further 4 800 meals for people in need by inviting people to sponsor him on his challenge. Ladles of Love has been serving the homeless community for over four years, providing a hot, healthy meal in three locations each week. As a result, Diliberto became more aware of the issues the homeless community face. “There is a huge gap in our society - for the ‘haves’, it’s almost impossible to comprehend how the other half live. With more than an estimated 7000 people in Cape Town alone who are homeless, it’s time to change,” he said. The purpose of the challenge is to change the narrative on homelessness and get the public to ask why this is happening in society and how they can make a difference. He will spend at least 24 hours on the streets and if his R40 000 target is met, Diliberto will up this to 48 hours. He will spend time with some local homeless organisations so that the public can support them. He plans to document his journey starting on November 29.
