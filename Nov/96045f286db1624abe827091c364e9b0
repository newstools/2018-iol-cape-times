Daryl van Noie, 42, was awarded for his sterling work in fighting crime in the area. Van Noie said one of the highlights of his career was the arrest of five suspects in an armed attack on a female Emergency Medical Service (EMS) staff member. He said the attack took place last year on June 5, at about 12.50am, and the suspects were apprehended within 40 minutes. Speaking about the award, he said: “I did not expect it. It is a privilege to be acknowledged. This is not just a job, but a calling, as I always wanted to be a detective. The gratitude from the complainant is more than enough. “I treat all my cases with the serious attention they require,” he said. The award is a new Community Safety department initiative, to recognise efforts which pursue the creation of a safer Western Cape. Community Safety MEC Alan Winde said: “I commend him for his dedication to combating crime. “He epitomises what it means to be a hero, bringing justice for the people of his community through his professional and hard work.” He said Van Noie was assisted by vigilant Heideveld residents who provided information he needed to make swift arrests. Three of the accused have subsequently been sentenced to 12 years behind bars. The trial of the remaining two continues. Winde also gave 61 newly accredited neighbourhood watches their formal certificates. “I am thrilled to be accrediting 61 neighbourhood watches from 30 areas. “We now have 291 accredited NHW’s in the province, all of which have undergone training,” he said. sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
