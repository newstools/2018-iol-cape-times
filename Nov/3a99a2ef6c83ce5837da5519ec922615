Parliament - New Home Affairs Minister Siyabonga Cwele has some tough challenges ahead of him, Parliament's oversight committee said on Friday. In a statement, the home affairs portfolio committee welcomed Cwele's appointment and said MPs were eager to work with him to solve the problems bedevilling the home affairs department. "One of the key challenges for the new minister will be to resolve the lingering challenge of long queues at service points across the country. In addition, the intermittent challenges with server downtime that hampers the rendering of services must be urgently resolved," committee chairman Hlomani Chauke said. "The implementation of measures announced by the President to increase tourism numbers and cut red tape to facilitate investment is paramount." Cwele was appointed on Thursday following a Cabinet reshuffle. He replaces Malusi Gigaba who resigned earlier this month after a series of controversies. African News Agency/ANA
