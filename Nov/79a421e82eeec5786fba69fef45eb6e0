Cape Town - A 60-year-old man and his 27-year-old accomplice were allegedly caught red-handed with drugs with a street value of around R8.6 million in Somerset West. They were allegedly off-loading drugs at a storage facility on Friday, the SABC reported. According to Western Cape Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase, tik and mandrax were found inside the suspects’ vehicle and the storage unit, including two elephant tusks and a money counting machine. All the items were seized. The Hawks teams then proceeded to the suspects’ home in Wetton, Nkwalase said, where they confiscated more drugs worth more than R800 000, an undisclosed amount of money and another vehicle. Nkwalase said two separate cases of dealing in drugs have been opened in Somerset West and Lansdowne respectively. The two suspects are expected to appear in court soon. On Wednesday, the Hawks’ Narcotics Enforcement Bureau added three other suspects as part of the ongoing efforts to clamp down on drugs in the Western Cape. Two weeks ago a Hawks and Crime Intelligence operation led to the arrest of Mogamat Rafiek Hayners, 24, and the recovery of various drugs ranging from heroin, tik and mandrax valued at more than R8.9 million allegedly concealed at a storage facility in Somerset West earlier this month. Russel Stanton Jonathan, 53, Mark Overmeyer, 51, and Zaynisa Alfoz, 45, were apprehended in various parts of Cape Town for their alleged involvement on the drugs seized at the storage facility.
