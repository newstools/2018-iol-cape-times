Cape Town – The ANC in the Western Cape is of the opinion that the recently appointed mayoral committee (Mayco) in the City of Cape Town confirms the reality of a "highly divided DA". On Sunday, Executive Mayor Dan Plato announced his committee, with a number of new faces, which include former MP James Vos. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs told the SABC the composition of the committee shows that all those who supported former mayor Patricia de Lille have effectively been given the boot. “Those who are raising concerns about their masters are now being dealt with. Patricia and her group have been dealt with very significantly and the victors are sharing the spoils." Jacobs believes this is tantamount to "jobs for pals" and "more about the control of the pot of resources" and to "ensure the resources don't go to the people on the Cape Flats, but rather to those who want to entrench, support and protect privilege”. But Plato said on Sunday "the inference that members were selected out of any type of reward for opposing his predecessor was disingenuous and a disservice to the selected Mayco".
