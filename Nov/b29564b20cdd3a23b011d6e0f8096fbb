Cape Town - There are two types of people in the world when it comes to Black Friday. You are either in the queue with your trolley full of cheap items or you slam the day and the keen shoppers. Black Friday is known to be the biggest sale of the year, with prices of groceries, appliances and clothing slashed to low prices. It originally started in the US to mark the start of Thanksgiving and the Christmas shopping season. Now, retailers around the world have jumped on the 'Black Friday' bandwagon and use the day as an opportunity to get more sales in stores and online shops. The Black Friday rush started at midnight in some areas, leaving shoppers aggressively trying to get what they want. However, not all South Africans feel the same way about the US tradition.  This black Friday is playing mind games with our people ,the things that are on special it's actually their prices #BlackFriday2018   Yo @Shell, @SasolSA, @BP_SouthAfrica, @Caltexsa, yall forgetting something? #BlackFriday2018 pic.twitter.com/FAfGztCqzm   #blackfriday2018 in #southafrica really interests me because I think that after today loads of people are going to be in debt #money   Looking at #BlackFriday2018 "specials" in South Africa ðŸ˜’ pic.twitter.com/B0mrrkwWlJ   #BlackFriday2018 south Africa is going to be crazy!!!
