The bill, which permits the sale of alcohol at schools, was passed in the legislature and will now go through a second reading debate before it is published as an act. Sadtu said it is horrified by the implication the “anti-education legislation” will have on education. Sadtu provincial chairperson Jonovan Rustin said the bill undermined collective bargaining and the establishment of the School Evaluation Authority undermined the Education Labour Relations Council Resolution 8/2003, which binds the department. “The province is abdicating its responsibility to provide quality public education through the introduction of collaboration schools. Partners to the schools use their money to govern these schools thus undermining the voice of the parents.” The proposed amendments were announced in 2016, and the standing committee on education had conducted public hearings on the bill. Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said they are “open to innovative ways of delivering education” and they have effective and efficient ways of assessing how well schools were performing. “I am therefore delighted that after more than two years, the Western Cape Provincial School Education Amendment Bill was passed by the Western Cape Provincial Parliament. “Regulations will now be published for public comment.”
