They also vowed to be present at all the court appearances the accused will make. The man made a brief appearance at the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court and stands accused of raping and impregnating his 13-year-old relative. The man has been a member of the DA since last year and worked for the City as a community liaison officer until earlier this year. DA federal youth leader Luyolo Mphithi said they had learnt with horror that one of their members had been accused of rape. “During his appearance, our own DA members pledged their support to the family and went to the court to condemn the actions this alleged perpetrator has been accused of.” He said the party, particularly the DA youth, needed to take a strong stance when people were accused of heinous crimes. “This should not shock us only during 16 days of activism. We should be as animated by crime against women and children every single day.” He said the DA youth had written to the party leadership to ensure that the accused is suspended as a DA member until the law has taken its course.
