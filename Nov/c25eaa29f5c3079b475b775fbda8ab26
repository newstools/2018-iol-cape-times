Nick, with his partner, Jamie Riddle, won the men's race while his sister Alexandra and her partner, Vicky van der Merwe, took the first place in the women's category. Not only did Nick and Riddle win the men's category of the third annual 16km run/swim from Sandy Bay to Clifton they also broke the previous record of 2 hours 18 minutes, by clipping five minutes off the clock, for a new time of 1:55.01. “We knew it was going to be a tight race. We worked really well together and complemented each other in the swims and the runs. "We didn't enter the water first for the first swim, so we knew we had our work cut out for us. All in all a very tough race,” said Nick. Alexandra and Van der Merwe won the women's category in 2:25.20, clipping a minute off the old record. Van der Merwe said: “Being my first Torpedo SwimRun, we decided to go out quite conservatively. Alex is a very good swimmer, so I had paddles on and tried to sit on her feet. "Alex did most of the work on the swims, and then we ran really well together.” Race director Richard McMartin said: “In the men's and the women's (categories), records have tumbled, with some top triathletes coming and racing. "The pumping south-easter made conditions tricky, but we have a lot of excited people ready for next year.” Cape Times
