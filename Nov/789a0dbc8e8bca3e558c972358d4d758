Cape Town – The Lansdowne Community Policing Forum has urged particularly women and partygoers to be vigilant after a consignment of Rohypnol (date rape) drugs destined for the black market in Cape Town was intercepted. CPF spokesperson Rafique Foflonker said they were very concerned after hearing that two men were bust in the Lansdowne police precinct earlier this week. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the arrest came after a successful intelligence-driven operation. “Gender-based violence and sexual crimes perpetrated against women are high priorities for the Western Cape police. “This priority led us to conduct an operation to intercept a consignment of Rohypnol, destined for the Cape Town black market. Information at our disposal indicated that the schedule 5 drug was dispatched from Durban, and our investigations resulted in a search operation at a residence in Lansdowne (on Monday) afternoon,” Traut said. Two suspects, aged 33 and 25, were arrested for being in possession of 200 Rohypnol tablets valued at about R30 000; dagga plants and other products, also valued at R30 000; as well as cash. Two vehicles were also confiscated. “We have reason to believe that the Rohypnol tablets were earmarked for sexual crimes against women. Once charged, the suspects are expected to make a court appearance in Wynberg,” Traut said. Foflonker said the bust made in Hanbury Road, Rondebosch East, prompted them to create immediate awareness in the community. “We have started an awareness campaign and have urged the community to be vigilant. The drug is very dangerous. It sedates you, and symptoms are like those of a very drunk person. "Victims cannot articulate what they are feeling and the drug also affects their memory. We want people to be mindful of who they accept drinks from,” Foflonker said.
