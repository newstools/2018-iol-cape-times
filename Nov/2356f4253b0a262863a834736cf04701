The awards, which recognise the contribution of NGOs that provide services to victims of crime, including trafficking in persons, were held on Monday at the Premier Hotel in Mpumalanga province. The awards were the highlight of the two-day National Indaba on the Crime of Trafficking in Persons, which ended on Tuesday. The Indaba was part of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children Campaign. Triangle Project was bestowed the award for their work in advocating and offering services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex plus (LGBTI+) persons, their partners and families. Triangle Project health and support services manager Sharon Cox said they appreciated the award, as the organisation had worked over many years under difficult circumstances, to provide holistic and quality services to LGBTI+ community. “It is important for the organisation that victims are well prepared for court, that they are supported in court and are provided with emotional wellness services throughout the case and for as long as they need support.” In February, Sigcine Mdani was sentenced at the Western Cape High Court to 15 years’ imprisonment for the murder of Swelindawo, then a 22-year-old. Mdani had stamped on Swelindawo’s head and kicked her in the face several times on December 2, 2016. Two days later, he broke into her home, kidnapped and killed her. Swelindawo’s body was found near a footbridge, on the N2 in Driftsands. Mdani was sentenced to three years for assault to inflict grievous bodily harm, five years for housebreaking and kidnapping, 15 years for murder and two years for possession of an unlicensed firearm and illegal ammunition.
