Cape Town – Western Cape Tourism and Economic Opportunities Minister Beverly Schäfer has called on residents to help create an environment in which tourism can grow in the province. On World Tourism Day, Schäfer cautioned that rampant crime and social instability can jeopardise the benefits of tourism, the SABC reported. Schäfer said both local and international tourists contribute immensely to the growth of the local economy. But she believes the tourism industry also needs to prove that tourism is also economically and socially responsible. "In the Western Cape, tourism is one of our major job creators, creating more than 300 000 direct and indirect job opportunities. "By committing to using more local suppliers and services and fair labour practices, the tourism industry can show that tourism is also economically and sociably responsible."
