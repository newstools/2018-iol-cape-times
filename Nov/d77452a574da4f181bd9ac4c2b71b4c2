The awards will recognise individuals, organisations and institutions involved in initiatives aimed at making a social impact in various sectors. The Survé Philanthropies, the private foundation which houses several of the Survé family’s philanthropic initiatives, announced the launch of the Imagine Awards earlier this month. Nearly 100 nominations were received from across the country. Of these, 33 individuals and organisations made it to the shortlist in various categories, including arts and culture; disability; technology; human rights; media; education; women; children and poverty alleviation. Twelve special awards will also be conferred on individuals who have made a contribution to social justice. The recipients of the Imagine Awards will also be assisted with funding towards their respective initiatives. Among the guests will be Edmond de Rothschild Foundation chief executive Firoz Ladak. He said: “I look forward to the awards. It brings up the question: is philanthropy only for the rich? Philanthropy is about being action driven. You can reward anybody who does good.” Ladak will this weekend host the 6th Empower Families for Innovative Philanthropy in Franschhoek, welcoming about 25 to 30 wealthy families involved in Frontier Philanthropies to exchange their experiences and best practices and to collaborate.
