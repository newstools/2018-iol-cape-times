Cape Town – The three men found guilty of the kidnapping, rape and murder of Stellenbosch University student Hannah Cornelius and the brutal attack on her friend Cheslin Marsh have received life sentences. In the Western Cape High Court on Monday, Vernon Witbooi and Geraldo Parsons were sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder and life for her rape. The duo received 25 years each for the attempted murder of her friend, Clinton Marsh, 15 years for four counts of robbery and 10 years for their kidnapping and that of Mimi October. Eben van Niekerk received life sentences for Cornelius' rape and murder, 20 years for each robbery, 10 years for kidnapping Marsh and Cornelius, eight years for kidnapping October and 20 years for the attempted murder of Marsh. Nashville Julius was handed 15 years for two counts of robbery and seven years for the students' kidnapping. His sentences will run concurrently. None of the accused showed true remorse, Judge Rosheni Allie said. There could be no doubt that the four were lucid during their modus operandi, he said. It was appalling that they kept Cornelius with them after dumping Marsh, as it showed they wanted to take full advantage of her, Judge Allie said. Her rape was intended to bring her to complete subjugation, "violating her privacy, dignity and humanity". The manner in which they preyed on Cornelius made it the "crudest and cruellest form of violence".
