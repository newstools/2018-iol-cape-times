They were from early childhood development (ECD) centres, the Grassy Park Educare, Rhoda-Tul-Aftaal 1, Rhoda-Tul-Aftaal 2, Teddy’s Educare and Square Hill Nursery School. The event on Tuesday was hosted by the Centre for Early Childhood Development (CECD) and the Cape Town Museum of Childhood to commemorate the day and to promote international togetherness, awareness among children worldwide and improving children’s welfare. This was the third year that the two NGOs celebrated the day with children at Nantes Park. The event is aimed at bringing children together through a common theme of play and sports. Playing is a crucial part of children’s early development as well as socialisation with other children, according to the centre. Universal Children’s Day also marks the anniversary of the date that the UN General Assembly adopted both the declaration and the convention on children’s rights. The day started with a park run with all the children, followed by activities such as an egg and spoon race, three-legged race, sack race and relay race. The winning ECD centre (Teddy’s Educare) took home a big trophy - all the children were winners and received a small trophy for participating. CECD and the Cape Town Museum of Childhood expressed their thanks to all the participating ECD centres, “and most importantly, to the young children who embraced the fun”. This year, the UN is asking the world to “Go Blue” in celebration of Universal Children’s Day. “Go Blue” activities included sharing the UN’s promo video for Children’s day, signing the global petition and “going blue” in support of children’s rights on social media.
