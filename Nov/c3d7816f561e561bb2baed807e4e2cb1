This comes after the vehicle used by local NGO Philisa Abafazi Bethu to transport children and the elderly in the community was broken into and vandalised in Hilary Drive yesterday. Director Lucinda Evans said the incident had rocked her to her “woman core” when she realised the organisation’s donated vehicle, which had been parked in her driveway for the past four years, was broken into, its battery stolen and her driveway gate lifted from its rails. “The incident must have happened between 2am and 3am. “I am more disappointed than I am angry. This is a cruelty to our community because this transports the people of this community,” Evans said. She added that the thieves had disarmed the vehicle’s alarm system. “They caused extensive damage after ripping out the electric cabling in the van. We have since had a business in Diep River offer to check the damage and get an auto electrician to see to it. "However, the organisation had to fork out R750 just to have it towed to these kind people who are helping us. “The Somerset West Night Shelter has also offered to buy our battery for us, and we are so grateful for the help,” she said. Evans said having interrupted service for about 72 hours would be a disadvantage to Lavender Hill’s elderly people and youth. “We pick up survivors, the van also services the Child Protection campaign in which we have an after-school programme, and it also affects our women empowerment programme. “These criminals see our community is struggling.” Evans said the van was also used for food distribution to victims who suffered in the recent Overcome Heights blaze.
