Cape Town – The Ex-Robben Island Political Prisoners Association of South Africa (EPPA) is threatening to occupy prison cells on the island while embarking on a hunger strike. This is if the island's management continues to ignore their plight, the SABC reported on Thursday. Their gripes include that their welfare as former political prisoners has allegedly been disregarded and that they are not drawing economic benefit from the World Heritage Site. Representing about 1 500 former political prisoners on the island, EPPA national secretary Mpho Masemola claimed the institution is falling into disrepair under the current management. This has led to them calling for the resignation of the chief executive of the Robben Island Museum, Mava Dada. "The EPPA has called this briefing to highlight a series of questions that have been put to the Robben Island Museum and the entire Robben Island council," Masemola said. "Mava Dada stands accused of disregarding the experiences, contributions and welfare of former political prisoners and running the island as his personal fiefdom." The Robben Island Museum said it would respond to the allegations on Friday.
