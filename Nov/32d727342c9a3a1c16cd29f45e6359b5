A total of 6 619 people attended the event. Tarryn Jooste from K-Way was crowned first princess, followed by Chancia Bailey from Reliance Clothing as second princess. Colleen October from Keedo International received the Best Dressed title, while Miss Personality went to Simone Hazell from White House. The event featured local artists such as The Rockets, Lady Zamar and past winners of the “Sactwu’s Own Talent” competition. Hailing from Bereaville in the Overberg area, the 25-year-old August said she did not expect to win. “It hasn’t sunk in, I felt honoured. I started crying after they mentioned my name. There was so much beauty and personality among the contestants. My mindset was not on winning, it was just about enjoying myself.” She said she felt like a celebrity in her designer gown. “When you’re on that stage you become a whole other person. I am grateful to Sactwu for giving us this experience of life outside the factory.” Modelling has been a passion for August since primary school. She said while she had only been working in the industry for 10 months, entering the competition was a must. “I love modelling and feeling beautiful, and pageants are fun.” She said the highlight of the event was meeting people from different factories and getting to know them. “The build-up was also very exciting with all the practice sessions and then on Saturday it all came together, it felt so real,” she said. For August, her goal is to “change the mindsets of woman who undermine themselves and do not feel confident in their own skin”. She hoped that through her win, she would be an encouragement to other women. This year’s Spring Queen event had the second largest attendance since the event was first hosted at Athlone Stadium in 2015. Cape Times
