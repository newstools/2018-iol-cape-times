Cape Town – Many Bo-Kaap residents were adamant that they were going to stop a crane from entering the area so that work on a high-rise building could begin. They were granted their wish on Wednesday, cheering and waving as a crane belonging to construction company Blok left the neighbourhood. "Allah has granted us a short victory. Our fight is going to continue," Bo-Kaap Collective leader Shafwaan Loubscher told News24. "Our fight is not going to stop here, we will continue with our fight for the liberation of Bo-Kaap. Our fight against anti-gentrification will continue." On Tuesday, police had to use tear gas to keep protesters at bay as they escorted the crane to its destination in Lion Street, which led to the arrest of five people. The charges were later dropped against them. "All the charges were withdrawn. They were charged with contravening the Road Traffic Act and contravention of the interim interdict obtained by Blok," lawyer Seehaam Samaai said. "The charges were withdrawn because they were difficult to prove."     In comparison, on Wednesday a handful of elderly people waited peacefully for hours for the removal of the crane, News24 reported. The Muslim Judicial Society (MJC) expressed its shock at "the blatant display of police brutality toward the elderly residents of Bo-Kaap". "The way the police and a private security company manhandled our elderly mothers and fathers in the community is appalling," MJC secretary-general Shaykh Isgaak Taliep said. "The brutality of the police and the private security company must be investigated and those found to use excessive force must be harshly disciplined." The MJC acknowledged the community's pleas for the neighbourhood to be declared a heritage site. "Years of pleas to declare Bo-Kaap a heritage site have fallen on deaf ears. It is for this reason that the residents have decided to peacefully protest – a right enshrined in the Bill of Rights – against gentrification in the area."
