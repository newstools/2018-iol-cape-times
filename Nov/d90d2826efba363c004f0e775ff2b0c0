Cape Town – Convicted triple axe murderer Henri van Breda's next – and last – resort would have to be the Constitutional Court in his hopes to be freed. The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein dismissed an application by Van Breda for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence on Tuesday. In August, the Western Cape High Court had also dismissed his appeal bid. The Supreme Court of Appeal's decision was confirmed to News24 by his attorney, Lorinda van Niekerk, who said she could not confirm whether they would be taking the matter to the Constitutional Court. "We are considering our position. We have not yet decided on the next step," she said. In June, Van Breda was sentenced to three life terms for the murders of his parents and brother, and 15 years for the attempted murder of his sister. He received a further 12-month sentence for obstructing the course of justice. Van Breda had pleaded not guilty, blaming the crimes on an intruder who breached their home in the De Zalze estate in Stellenbosch. His advocate, Piet Botha, had argued that evidence against Van Breda was purely circumstantial and that the State had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt he had committed murder.
