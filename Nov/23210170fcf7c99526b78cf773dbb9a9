When asked how she felt, she broke into a gospel song thanking Jesus. Idols SA presenter Proverb said the show had received a record of over 142 million votes. While Yanga was giving it her best at the live event in Johannesburg, the community of Delft came out in their thousands in support. A fan park event was held at the Voorbrug sports grounds with a line-up of local singers and dancers as everyone waited in anticipation for the finale. The event was organised by wward 13 councillor Michelle Adonis and a group of supporters calling themselves Team Yanga. Team Yanga supported the young singer since she entered the competition through campaigning efforts which saw them go from door to door throughout the community with Yanga branded T-shirts, encouraging people to vote. Adonis said: “She is our daughter. There is a lot of negativity associated with Delft, we need to tell this positive story. "It is an inspiration for our youth.” Family friend Bulelwa Manzana said Yanga always loved singing. “She has been singing from a young age and she always wanted to enter Idols, but she was too young. "Winning this competition will change her life for the better.” Manzana said she came from a humble family who loved God. "She is one of four daughters," Manzana said. Resident Olivia Ochan said that she was touched by what Yanga stood for. “I came out to support her because I see what kind of person she is. She is a very spiritual person. "For a 17-year-old I admire her because she can be a very good role model for all our youth in Delft and especially our young girls. I like what she stands for.” Cape Times
