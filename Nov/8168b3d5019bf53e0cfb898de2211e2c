With November being respiratory awareness month, a physiotherapist at UCT Private Academic Hospital, Marcelle Lake, has challenged people without lung problems such as asthma and cystic fibrosis, to try to feel what it’s like to have trouble breathing. To complete the #BreatheEasyChallenge, participants must find a paper straw, place it in their mouth and perform an exercise like brisk walking, cycling, running or any other exercise. Participants can only use this method to breathe. According to the World Health Organisation, around 65 million people suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and 3million die from it each year, making it the third leading cause of death worldwide. About 334 million people suffer from asthma, the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting 14% of all children globally. Lake said she felt it was important for people to understand what it was like to have problems breathing. “We don’t just want to raise awareness, but also want people to see how important it is to take care of their lungs, and also the importance of being an organ donor. "To create awareness you cannot use just one day, you need the whole month.” She said seeing someone come into their practice and gasping and being hungry for air was also a motivator for the challenge. “It’s not an immediate replication and we do have patients who have end-stage diseases, and breathing through a straw is what it is like for them.” She said the challenge had gained some traction but hoped more people would join. “Family members and nurses of those who have lung diseases who have tried the challenge said they finally understood what the patients were going through, and were more empathetic. “We as normal people can remove the straw and know what it’s like to breathe normally again. “Many of the patients may require transplants, but the challenge is to make people aware of donating organs and to notify their families that they want to be organ donors.”
