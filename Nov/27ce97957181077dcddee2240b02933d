Green, in collaboration with Jack Friedman, created a jewellery piece that showcases her love for South Africa as well as elements from Cape Town. The design of the necklace, named the National Gift to the Universe, celebrates Green’s home with Table Mountain. Her brief to Friedman was to create a positive message about the country and what better symbol than the recent rains, which have broken the drought. Symbols in the neck piece - the rain drops, South Africa’s national bird the Blue Crane and the national flower the Protea - are portrayed in the side disks of the pendant. The piece is completed with a map of Africa engraved with the face of Nelson Mandela. The necklace will be auctioned off with proceeds going to charity. Miss Universe 2018 takes place on December 17 in Bangkok, Thailand.
