Herron recently resigned from the DA after serving as mayoral committee member for urban development, saying he was “disgusted” at the refusal of the DA caucus to support the disposal of the Salt River Market site. He said he had charged numerous hurdles and delays had been placed before his team in relation to proposed affordable housing developments, and “it is clear there has all along been tacit high-level political support, or perhaps even direct interference, in these objections to the delivery of affordable housing in Cape Town”. Madikizela held a press conference, rejecting Herron’s claims and saying Herron was responsible for delays to affordable housing projects. When probed on the accusation and why the DA had not intervened in trying to speed up the development of affordable housing in the inner city, Madikizela said there were legal challenges to the projects. “Brett left when he had to respond to allegations quoted in the Bowman’s report. The party took action because we want answers,” Madikizela said. There were two other court challenges on projects and they were waiting for the court process to run its course. “We had some challenges, but we are dealing with them. We are taking action against wrong-doing,” Madikizela said. He admitted that very little had been done on the inner city affordable housing development. “That is why eight years ago we took a bold step to identify land to roll-out developments, which are currently at various stages of development,” he said. Of the Salt River site, DA regional chairperson Grant Twigg said the party was compiling information to present to the council on a date as yet to be set. Cape Times
