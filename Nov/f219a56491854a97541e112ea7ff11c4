About 300 people walked through the streets of the Swartland town to deliver a memorandum of demands to Mayor Tijmen van Essen. Community leader Amber Jacobs said the municipality had for years treated black and coloured residents unequally when it came to service delivery and law enforcement. Jacobs said the municipality was also harsher towards residents of colour when it came to the provision of water and electricity. “These are council houses with huge tariffs. All the residents have are kettles and stoves and their bills end up being thousands per month. ‘‘If you are 20 cents in arrears, your electricity is cut, and you have to pay a R50 penalty when you want it reinstalled. White residents get a grace period,” Jacobs said. A municipal representative responded on behalf of Van Essen and said an official response to the demands would be issued within the next two to three weeks. “The mayor is not aware of any discriminatory practices as claimed with regards to service delivery and law enforcement,” the representative said.
