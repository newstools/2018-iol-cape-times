Cape Town – Over 300 residents have marched to the Delft SAPS to demand why the killers of Zeenith Daniels, 20, have not been brought to book. Zeenith’s body was found dumped on an open field on Delft Main Road on 7 May, but residents say six months later there have been no arrests. The woman’s half-naked body, with a stab wound to the chest, was found by a school child in a field in Leiden. Her brutal murder sparked outrage among residents, who tore down the bushes a week later. Aunt Koelsum Jacobs, 54, says Zeenith’s grieving mom, Zanap, 49, arranged the march. “There were more than 300 people that came out and Zanap arranged it because there are no answers from the police. It is a nightmare! Nobody has been arrested and there is no progress with the case. The group was joined by Mayor Dan Plato, who said the anger of the community was evident. “I visited the family when the incident happened and attended the march at the request of her mother. The people were terribly upset because there has been no progress. "This is why the guys just continue killing and raping because it takes so long for them to get caught,” the mayor says. Police did not respond to requests for comment.
