Ngesi said he had been involved for the past four or five years. “I was born in Gugs and my cousin is one of the organisers, so being involved is very special to me. This year’s race day is especially significant as it is the 60th anniversary of Cape Town’s oldest township,” he said. “I have run the race before and it’s always been amazing. Seeing people run around the township, a lot of runners have sweets on hand to give to the kids, the kids are so excited they have plastic bags out already waiting.’ The RCS Gugs Race was established in 2000, a year after the death of American anti-apartheid activist Amy Biehl in Gugulethu. The event still honours her spirit of compassion, but has forged ahead to inspire a family atmosphere. The vision has always been to instil a running culture among residents of this township and the chairperson of the Gugulethu Athletics Club, Aubrey Shoko, intends to build on this legacy. The RCS Gugs Race is accessible to runners of all fitness levels and includes a 4.2km as well as a 10km option. Ngesi said: “Anyone who can put one foot in front of the other should come bring your sweets, your running shoes and have fun.”. Entries at www.entrytime.com or at the venue on race day from 5.30 am.
