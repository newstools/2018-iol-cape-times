Baepi is expected to appear before a disciplinary hearing in Joburg today. The incidents allegedly took place at Old Mutual’s Cape Town offices. The Cape Times understands that he was placed on suspension after a complaint was lodged. Old Mutual has remained tight-lipped on the allegations. Approached for comment and details of the hearing, spokesperson Tabby Tsengiwe said it could not divulge anything. “Old Mutual is committed to making its work environment safe and free from any form of harassment. “Old Mutual takes sexual harassment very seriously and investigates any allegations of misconduct with diligence and due process in terms of its policies and procedures. “We cannot comment on the allegations as we regard any employee matter as confidential between employer and employee,” Tsengiwe said. Approached for comment, Baepi said that he was aware there may be a third complaint but had not been updated about the status of the complaints. “I have subjected myself to the process and have given my co-operation. I hope for a fair outcome and that the rights of all parties are respected,” he said. Baepi has been on paid suspension for the past six weeks, and said preliminary hearings had already taken place. “(Today) is a continuation of that,” he said.
