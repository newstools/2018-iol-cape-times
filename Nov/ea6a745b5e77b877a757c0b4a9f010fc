From faithful mountain bike shoes worn during several gruelling races to trail running shoes collecting more dust than mud, this year’s BUCO Origin of Trails challenge is encouraging the public to let go and donate their shoes to a worthy cause. On November 24 and 25 at Coetzenburg in Stellenbosch, the event includes an individual two-day mountain biking stage race, with a long (50-60km/day) and medium (25-30km/day) race, plus a 10km fun ride. Bolton Footwear marketing manager Fahiem Frizlar said: “Participants and their families are encouraged to drop their old pairs of sports shoes at the Olympic International bins provided at the event. "These will then be distributed to needy children and adult charity organisations such as Aitsa, an aftercare centre in the heart of Kylemore in the Dwarsrivier valley with 180 children, Songo.info and others to spread some festive cheer.” Frizlar said shoes can be life-changing to those without. “Sports enthusiasts often wonder what to do with their worn sports shoes. "They can be put to excellent use by someone. Just toss them in a cold water wash and let them air dry. For someone, they’ll be as good as new.” A long-distance runner himself, Frizlar said by paying your old gear forward, participants help needy children and adults to get active. Olympic International will provide bins at various events around the country over the next 12 months. “Donate any old sports equipment, clothing and footwear. Everything collected will be distributed to needy beneficiaries.” Follow Olympic International on Facebook: www.facebook.com/Olympic-International or Instagram: Olympic_International.
