CAPE TOWN – Western Province Rugby has been cleared of the claims of unfair discrimination made by Stormers assistant coach Paul Treu. An independent investigation was conducted by legal firm Bowmans, and their final report, according to WP Rugby, states that no substance to the allegations of unfair discrimination or unfair labour practices by any WP Rugby officers, coaches or staff members was found. In early September this year, it was learnt that Treu had submitted a document detailing his grievances to the board after walking out of a Stormers season review meeting in July as he felt his input wasn’t valued by head coach Robbie Fleck and assistant Paul Feeney. Various associated individuals were interviewed as part of the investigation, some of them players – in the week building up to their last Currie Cup league away game against the Blue Bulls, and in the week of the final. According to WP Rugby chief executive Paul Zacks, the union is committed to transformation and good governance, and viewed the allegations in a serious light. “After an extensive investigation process that saw 29 associated people interviewed and numerous documents reviewed in this matter, we are pleased that the independent enquiry found that there was no foundation to the allegations,” he said. “We are eager to put this matter behind us now, so we can continue to focus on exceeding all the transformation objectives outlined in SA Rugby’s Strategic Transformation Plan,” said Zacks.
