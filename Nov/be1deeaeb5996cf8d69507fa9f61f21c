Parliament - National Assembly House Chairperson Thoko Didiza had some stern words for MPs after President Cyril Ramaphosa's question and answer session descended into chaos. On Tuesday, scuffles broke out, first between DA and EFF MPs and then between an EFF MP and an Agang MP following an ugly war of words. In the first instance, EFF MPs and DA MPs charged towards each other after DA chief whip John Steenhuisen called EFF MPs "VBS looters" following an interruption from EFF benches. EFF leader Julius Malema responded by calling Steenhuisen racist. House chair Thoko Didiza then struggled to keep the House in order as EFF members chanted "racists" while pointing fingers towards DA MPs, while DA MPS chanted "pay back the money" towards EFF MPs. The second fight, which followed minutes later, broke out between an MP from Agang Andries Tlouamma and EFF MP Nazier Paulsen. Swearing could be heard from one of the individuals. Didiza, before closing the session, rebuked MPs for their conduct and thanked Ramaphosa for continuing despite the chaos. "Ordinarily I would have said this has brought us to the end of our session... but I think it is important as a presiding officer and on behalf of this House to apologise to you [Ramaphosa] for what happened... and thank you for being patient. "I also want to indeed say to members none of us can be proud about what happened in the House today and I really think we should reflect a bit more, particularly the chief whips, on their roles and what their responsibilities are on their members and on the House." Didiza went on to say that MPs owed it to each other to be respectful towards each other in spite of their differences and respect the decorum of the House. She will make a ruling on the matter on Wednesday. IOL
