Director at Clowns Without Borders SA Susan Eriksson said: “We spoke to Zip Zap about strengthening the drama, clowning and performing arts skills of its students. The aim is that all the performers can perform these skills on stage. “The other objective for us is that we are always looking for freelance young performers whom we can include in our programme. "It is an exciting opportunity to give young performers strengthened skills, as well as increase their opportunities in the creative economy. We definitely have identified performers who could join our programme in 2019. “We have been active in South Africa and South Sudan last year and Malawi this year. Next year we will go to Djibouti to work in the refugee camps.” Eriksson said Clowns Without Borders SA was started by clown, performer and PhD in Social Intervention, Jamie Lachman, in 2007 in Kwa-Zulu-Natal. “What Clowns does is develop creative programmes that support the psycho-social wellbeing of children and families affected by crisis. That is our mission. Since we started we have reached 480 000 children on the continent of Africa.” Clowns Without Borders SA director Jayne Batzofin, who runs the workshop, said the transformation in the students was huge as they moved away from the idea of the big circus clown to understanding that clowning is based on genuine reactions and emotions. “There is a difference between trying to be funny to create laughter and for it coming naturally from within,” said Batzofin, who was trained at the prestigious and demanding ‘L’École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, in Paris.
