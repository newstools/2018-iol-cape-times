They were arrested following the murder of Yunus Kathrada, 65, and his son Ahmed Kathrada, 28, on November 1. Yunus is the late Ahmed Kathrada's nephew. Myburgh said Ahmed arrived home at 21:00 on that fateful day. While he was opening his gate and burglary door, he was attacked and overpowered by two people. "He was shot in the chest. In the meantime, his mother who was inside the house heard the noise and called on her husband to assist," said Myburgh. When Yunus opened the door he was shot in the head. He died on the spot. His wounded son, Ahmed, died on arrival at the hospital. Myburgh said the suspects fled without taking any items. A provincial task team was established and nine people were arrested, a firearm as well as two vehicles, allegedly used in the commission of the offence, were confiscated. African News Agency (ANA)
