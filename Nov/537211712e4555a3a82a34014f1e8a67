Afrika Tikkun recently launched the programme at its Centre in Orange Farm, a peri-urban area south of Joburg. With the family of activist Sandi Jacobson, they celebrated the garden with a harvest lunch this week. The project aims to instil a passion for agriculture from an early age while ensuring families learn to be food secure. Project co-ordinator Tim Abaa said the aim is to teach children about organic gardening principles and the many opportunities in agriculture. “Ultimately, the vision is to stir up a passion for agriculture as a career. Most youngsters see farming as something that doesn’t pay well, but there are many career paths. “You can be a statistician, a dietician or a scientist,” Abaa said. The project is in memory of human rights activist and Struggle hero, Jacobson, who dedicated her life to early childhood development and vegetable garden skills transfer. Afrika Tikkun group executive of partnerships and marketing, Onyi Nwaneri, said: “These youngsters will learn valuable gardening and agricultural concepts that could benefit them in future from an employment and entrepreneurial point of view.” At school teachers are taught how to integrate organic gardening into the curriculum and at home, parents can cultivate gardens with their children.
