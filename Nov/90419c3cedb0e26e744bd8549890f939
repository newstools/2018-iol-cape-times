Cape Town – Members of the Western Cape Flying Squad have arrested two hijackers shortly after they robbed a courier company vehicle in Kuils River. They drove off with jewels and cellphones but were nabbed with the stolen cargo after crashing during a high-speed chase, News24 reported. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the van was hijacked by three gunmen in Sunbird Park at 10.30am on Thursday. Traut said the flying squad responded swiftly and, when they spotted the vehicle, gave chase. Shots were exchanged between police and the hijackers, and the driver of the Corsa eventually lost control and crashed on the R300. Traut said the perpetrators, aged 34 and 35, were caught with the stolen cargo in their possession. The firearm used in the robbery, a 9 mm Norinco, with seven rounds of ammunition, was also recovered. A third suspect managed to evade arrest and is being sought. One of the suspects was admitted to hospital with injuries. They will appear in the Kuils River Magistrate's court once charged.
