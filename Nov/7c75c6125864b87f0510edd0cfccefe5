Survé Philanthropies, the private foundation which houses several of the Survé family’s philanthropic initiatives, announced the launch of its inaugural Imagine Awards which will recognise individuals, organizations and institutions who are actively involved in initiatives aimed at making a social impact in various sectors. Announcing the launch, Dr Iqbal Survé, founder and chairman of the Sekunjalo Group said that the Imagine Awards is the culmination of the Survé family’s support for initiatives which promote the transformation of South Africa and Africa’s social and economic landscapes. For over two decades, the Survé family has pledged most of its wealth generated from investments, including that of the Sekunjalo Group, through several family foundations. The foundations are active in various areas including education, arts, music, culture, childrens’ rights, human rights and climate change. “While we have supported numerous projects over the years, the Imagine Awards is about honouring and paying tribute to individuals and organization that are working tirelessly, and often against all odds, to bring about change for a better society and a better world. “If every person can imagine a better world and strive towards creating that better world, whether it is in the workplace, at home, in the community, in the neighbourhood, within sports organisations or wherever you find yourself, then we will indeed have a better world”, said Dr Survé. Through the Imagine Awards, the Survé family has decided to recognize and reward organisations and individuals working towards making a social impact. The recipients of the Imagine Awards will also be assisted with funding towards their respective initiatives. According to Trudy Rushin, the project co-ordinator of Survé Philanthropies, 13 award categories have been identified. These include Arts & Culture, Children, Education, Environmental Sustainability and Women.
