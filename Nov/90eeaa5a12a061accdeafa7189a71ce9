Cape Town - Western Cape police have arrested a 24-year-old man for the murder of John Curran, the outgoing director of education for Mellon Educate in South Africa. The suspect was arrested in Voortrekker Road on Friday night and he is expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday where he is facing a charge of murder. Sixty-year-old Curran had been found in his Buitengracht Street flat "in a pool of blood" by his girlfriend. He had open wounds to his head and face, police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said. Curran’s phone was the only item stolen from the apartment. Curran had just completed a two-year contract with the Ireland-based African development charity and he was on holiday in Cape Town for a number of weeks. Irish media reported that he had been set to return home to Dublin in a few days. IOL and Weekend Argus
