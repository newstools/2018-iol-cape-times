Cape Town – A City traffic officer was shot in Phola Park on Thursday afternoon while conducting a vehicle checkpoint. He was shot in the thigh by two suspects, who subsequently fled with his service pistol, said City mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith. "The officer drove himself to hospital, where he is currently receiving medical care. He is in a stable condition," said Smith. "We do not know all of the details yet, but we condemn this callous attack and we are offering a reward for any information that could help track down the suspects. "On behalf of the City, I wish the officer a speedy recovery and we will assist him with trauma counselling and other services available through our Employee Wellness Programme." Earlier on Thursday Law Enforcement officers conducted routine operations in the Zonnebloem area in the CBD. The focus of the operation was to deal with by-law transgressions in the area. "Many of the offences dealt with in terms of the Streets and Public Places By Law involved people sleeping rough," said the City.
