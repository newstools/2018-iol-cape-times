The foundation was faced with a financial crisis earlier this month, with management saying they were looking into scaling down operations. Managing director Kevin Chaplin said yesterday that they were considering cutting back on some of the programmes and services they offer, such as an After School Centre in Khayelitsha. “It is one of the hardest decisions I’ve had to make. There are children in Khayelitsha who rely on our support and it pains me to cut back on the service we have provided,” He said. The organisation was founded by the parents of Amy Biehl, an American student killed during protests in 1993. The centre had a number of blows including a protest by employees of the foundation. The Department of Social Development said they pulled funding from the facility as it is non-compliant and not registered. Chaplin said it has become increasingly difficult to keep the foundation afloat over the past few years. “It has become increasingly difficult to sustain regular income and to keep our projects running. “A stagnant economy has meant that many corporates are cutting back on social investment. “As a result, raising the much-needed funds for all our projects has become a massive challenge, and one that we have not always been able to overcome,” he said. He said over the past eight months they have been trying to balance the need for the centre in the community against very limited resources and financial restraints. Employees began protesting last week, accusing management of unfair dismissals, corruption and misuse of funds. Facilitator at the foundation, Anele Nomandla said the protest was a last resort, after raising their concerns to the board and management. “We are lodging our cases with the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and the department of labour because we have a case here.” Cape Times
