Johannesburg - Axed Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama has criticised former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan for her testimony at the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture. Hogan told commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo earlier this week that the former president Jacob Zuma had pushed for Gama "and no one else" to be appointed CEO. She also testified that she was unfairly treated by the pro-Zuma camp. "I cast as an anti-transformation racist who did not appreciate the necessity for transformation in this country," she said. However, Gama has slammed her testimony. "Ms Barbara Hogan's submission is replete with inconsistencies and omissions, which he believes were deliberately advanced to further a nefarious agenda to vilify and damage Mr Gama’s reputation," said Gama's spokesperson, Gcobisa May. "For instance, it is an irrefutable fact that due to Mr Gama’s proven track record of accomplishments within the Transnet group, he was more than well-qualified to apply for the position of GCEO." May said Gama had accepted the position of GCOO offered to him by Maria Ramos. He accepted the role in October 2008. Gama refutes the claims made against him and has taken legal action, requesting the right to cross-examine Hogan. "Contrary to what has been published and broadcasted in the media, Mr Gama will, in due course, show how his stewardship as the GCEO of Transnet resulted in the best financial performance in the history of the Transnet Group. It is also the only SOE that does not require a government bail-out."
