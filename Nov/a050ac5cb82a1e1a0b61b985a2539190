Police say the unit, launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa, has been hard at work and has recorded some successes. A tip-off saw the unit conducting an operation at a house in Philippi. “This operation led to the discovery of two 9mm pistols, a .45 calibre pistol, 70 rounds of ammunition, dagga valued at R1 million and heroin with a street value of R129 950. “Six cellphones and R11550 cash, believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking, were also confiscated. “The six suspects, aged between 23 and 35, are due in court to face charges of the possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition and dealing in drugs,” said a police statement. Western Cape police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula praised his members for their “valuable contribution in beating the scourge of gang-related crime in our province ahead of the festive season”. He encouraged the community to continue with their assistance by providing information about criminality. The arrests came hours after the provincial reaction team arrested four suspects with three unlicensed firearms in Nyanga and Khayelitsha.
