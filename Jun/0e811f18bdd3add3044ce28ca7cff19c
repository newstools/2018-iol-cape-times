Cape Town - The National Freedom Party (NFP) has called on the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema to be "more vigilant" when commenting on racial issues. This comes after Malema claimed that the majority of Indians are racist. Malema was speaking at his party’s Youth Day commemorations in Klerksdorp in the North West last weekend. “(The) majority of Indians hate Africans, (the) majority of Indians are racist, and we must never be scared to say that they are racist. “I’m not saying all Indians, I’m saying the majority of them,” he said. The party has warned Malema to not "fall in the the trap of apartheid colonisers." "His statement on Indians is raising racial tensions amongst the people, we believe that in as much as the country still forge unity and the rainbow nation, leaders are the ones who should be leading the unity we hope for, therefore we warn Malema for his utterances as they seek to further divide the divided nation," said NFP in a statement. "Julius Malema’s utterances are proving that we live in a more divided society than apartheid era, we have not yet heal and forgive that is why time and again such will occur unexpectedly. As NFP we don’t blame Mr Malema the entire nation needs racial trauma healing," said NFP spokesperson Sabelo Sigudu. IOL
