Johannesburg - The Freedom Charter was adopted 63 years ago and political parties and unions say the document still remains relevant as a guiding document to the needs of many South Africans. The charter was officially adopted 63 years ago on June 26 1955 in Kilptown. Its principles, which include "the people shall govern and "the land shall be shared among those who work it", are still viewed as revolutionary. Political parties such as the EFF have often accused the ANC of abandoning the document as a guide on how it should govern. The EFF said on Tuesday that it has always used the document as a guiding principle because it remains relevant today because the wealth of the country still remains in the hands of few. "The ANC has abandoned the Freedom Charter and are silencing the people who were part of drafting this document. Years after the first democratic elections, the wealth and land of our country still remains in the hands of the minority, with no substantive change in comparison to when the charter was adopted 63 years ago," said the EFF. READ: 63 years on, the Freedom Charter remains relevant On Monday ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa told delegates at the party's elections manifesto workshop that the party's 2019 manifesto should be revolutionary like Freedom Charter. The governing party was also criticised by trade union Numsa for failing to champion the economic demands laid out in the charter. The union said the country remains one of the most unequal in the world and it has placed the blame on the ANC led alliance. "South Africa is among the most unequal societies on earth thanks to the ANC led government for driving neoliberal reforms as opposed to driving a revolutionary agenda as prescribed in the freedom charter," said Numsa.
