“Once again the City chooses to miss an opportunity to show that it works for its people. Instead it chooses to keep water restrictions and the exorbitant tariff structure aimed at punishing anyone using water. “The City is not taking into account that there are many people who just cannot afford these forever-rising water tariffs. The City refers to themselves and the public as a ‘team’ and at the same time the City’s team has just one side - that is the City itself.” Just months after the day on which it had been predicted that the city would run out of water, deputy mayor Ian Neilson made an announcement yesterday that at this early stage of the winter season dam levels were already much higher than they  had been at the end of winter last year. Provided that adequate water restrictions were maintained, the City was confident there would be no Day Zero next year, Neilson said. “While we hope to reduce the current water restrictions in the near future and the tariffs associated with them, this decision is dependent on the government relaxing restrictions on releases from the water supply system,” he said. Dam levels stand at 43.7%. The latest figures show Capetonians are using 527 million litres of water a day, over the City’s daily usage target of 450ML. At the end of last winter, dam levels were at 38% and consumption was over 600 million litres a day. The City avoided Day Zero because of water already in the dams, intense water demand management programmes, unrelenting communication, awareness and behavioural change on the part of its citizens, Neilson said. With the announcement, Neilson said the City was anticipating escalating water use, but believed Capetonians would continue their water-saving efforts. “We are in the process of reassessing our water programme, in particular our future water mix and the role of permanent desalination in the supply mix,” Neilson said.
