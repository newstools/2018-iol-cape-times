Rafique Foflonker, spokesperson, said over the past weeks several people have opened cases of being robbed following withdrawals. “The idea of bank following is not a new thing. However, several robberies have been recorded in a short space of time, following withdrawals at an ATM or bank after the victims were followed. “Usually when we get big days like Easter, Christmas and now Eid al-Fitr, everyone goes to ATMs to withdraw money for charities or other things. “The criminals look for victims who are not vigilant. We found that some people go to the ATMs and don’t pay attention to their surroundings,” Foflonker said. He also warned tourists to be extra vigilant. “You can’t count your cash next to the ATM. Before you withdraw money you need to be mindful who is watching and, if someone looks suspicious, trust your gut and go away.” ATM scammers were getting more and more sophisticated in their attempt to con unsuspecting tourists, according to the Cape Town Central City Improvement District (CTCID). Muneeb Hendriks, the manager at the CTCID, said: “Criminals target tourists because they are easy pickings. “There are criminals who dress very well purporting to help tourists at ATMs, who subsequently rob them. “We have, for this reason, deployed officers at hot spots, and there has been a marked improvement.” To report crime contact Crime Stop 0860010111 or SMS 32211.
