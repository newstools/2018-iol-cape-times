The 34-year-old constable, from Bellville South police station, whose name will only be revealed in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, was arrested for allegedly taking part in the theft of 18 firearms. He made his first appearance in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said several firearms handed in as exhibits and earmarked for destruction went missing from a storeroom at the police station in August last year. The theft was linked to the police officer after SAPS Vispol members confiscated two firearms that were linked to the 18 stolen firearms, Mulaudzi said. He added that the suspect’s identity would only be revealed during his bail application. Sanco executive member and acting national spokesperson Motlalepula Rosho said ridding the SAPS of corrupt officials would restore confidence in policing. “It is outrageous that police officials are in some cases suppliers of guns responsible for the deaths of innocent, law-abiding citizens,” Rosho said. “Nothing less than a major clean-up will restore the credibility and integrity of the SAPS.” SA Police Union general secretary Oscar Skommere said officers were taught to keep their firearms safe. Failure to do so could lead to fines and suspension. “If you cannot explain or they are not convinced you did your best to protect your firearm, you end up being charged. If it contributed to a crime, you can get dismissed,” Skommere said.
