Danie de Wet has dedicated his run to rescue workers, paramedics, Netcare 911 and trauma surgeon Professor Kenneth Boffard, who saved his life. “I am very nervous, but very excited too, I can’t even sleep. 
I feel just like a kid.” He had taken part in six Comrades runs before the accident. The engineering supervisor was working on washing out a dam 3.5km underground in January 2015, using an extended crowbar to stir up the mud, when he suddenly slipped. He looked down and saw that the metal bar had penetrated his body, entering his groin area and coming out of his back, just below his shoulder blade. De Wet was airlifted to hospital and, after the extended crowbar was pulled completely free from his body, the doctors saw that the impalement had caused significant damage, destroying one kidney, and damaging his small bowel and numerous blood vessels. Although he lost a kidney, he made rapid progress and was discharged from hospital 19 days later. “When I thought I wouldn’t be able to run again, I felt very disappointed. Comrades is like a drug; if you experience it, you can’t get enough,” he said. “Just three-and-a-half years ago, my wife and colleagues were praying for my survival, and when I was able to walk out of hospital only 19 days later, we regarded it as a miracle. "That I have now qualified to take on the Comrades Marathon once more is truly remarkable.”
