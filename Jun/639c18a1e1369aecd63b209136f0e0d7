De Lille was key speaker at yesterday’s launch of the Marchelino Community Support Group at the Athlone Soccer Stadium, where she made her plea to over 70 parents, relatives of substance abusers, law enforcement officers, councillors and guests. “We want to work with you. We must put heads together to sort out the problem. As 
parents, we must help our 
children.” “I want to say to you parents who are here that we heard your cries for help. We know that as a community and City it is the responsibility of each and everyone of us to do all we can,” she said. De Lille said she knew it was not easy to solve the drug problem and that addiction
carried a stigma. Instead of trying to solve the problem, many parents sometimes looked the other way. As part of the launch, De Lille unveiled a plaque dedicated to the late Marchelino, who had been 30 years old at the time of his death. With Marcelino’s mother, Carol Hendricks, and his 16-year-old son Cody Hendricks beside her at the unveiling, the mayor said the project would be worthwhile if more young people were saved. Athlone ward 49 councillor Rashid Adams,who initiated the support group, said the reason for forming it was to support affected parents and relatives of substance abusing children and the substance abusers. “I’m very concerned about the amount of substance abuse in our community,” said Adams. The late Marchelino’s sister Dene Hendricks read a tribute to her brother and thanked the initiators for naming the support group in his honour. “My brother, like many young people, battled with substance abuse. “This is something which has become the norm for many of our basic social units/family structures. “Yes, he tried to change his habits for the better, but as 
anyone in that situation may know  it is not easy.”
