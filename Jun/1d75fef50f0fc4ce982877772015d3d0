Johannesburg - The power system remained constrained on Sunday, despite several units being returned to service during the morning, state power utility Eskom said on Sunday. The risk for loadshedding during the course of the day remained high due to a "shortage of capacity from the effects of the recent industrial action and will remain so in the coming week", Eskom said in a statement. The power system has been under pressure since trade unions at the utility went on strike over wages earlier in the week. "Some employees continue to work around the clock to restore stability to operations and supply. We assure customers that all available emergency energy resources are used before loadshedding is implemented," Eskom said. "We would like to apologise, but equally thank our customers who are helping us to improve by reporting variations in Eskomâ€™s loadshedding schedules. As a result these schedules are being revised." Eskom again encouraged residents and businesses to continue using electricity sparingly. Geysers should be switched off during the day, especially during peak periods (7am to 10am and 6pm to 9pm), as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. Remember to treat all electrical points as live during a power outage. Customers were advised to keep checking their loadshedding schedules on the Eskom and municipal websites, and plan on the assumption that load shedding would take place. For Eskom customers, these schedules were available on the Eskom website. Eskom customers could also contact the customer contact centre at 0860-037-566, Eskom said. African News Agency/ANA
