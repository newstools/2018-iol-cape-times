The organisation believes in uplifting youth through art, including programmes in music, dance and karate. After the success of their first cultural exchange in 2004, they were invited back. Now the team, made of young people from Gugulethu, Nyanga, Woodstock, Bonteheuwel and Rondebosch as well as Johannesburg and Overberg will be heading to Italy where they will do live karate demonstrations and take part in activities to exchange knowledge about the different countries and cultures. The team will be treated as special guests with a welcoming ceremony and a parade through the streets and special balloons will be released into the sky, followed by a press conference. Aside from doing the live demonstrations, they will also tour various islands and be involved in interactive programmes with local young 
people. Sipho Pokolo, 21, from Woodstock, said: “I have been doing karate since I was four. It has helped through the most difficult times in my life. ‘‘My instructor is more like a father figure than an instructor or trainer.” Pokolo won five medals at the Goju Kai World Championships in Canada last year. “I’m honoured to represent South Africa and karate in Italy,” he said. Anathi Kalipa, 18, from Gugulethu said: “It is a big thing to represent your country and I am very proud of the fact. “I look forward to making a good name for South Africa.” Karate teacher Frank Brandon said he was proud of his students. “This is an amazing opportunity. “These students are high achievers and this is a real cultural exchange where children can forge friendships while having fun. It is not just about karate, it is about life,” said Brandon. “We want to show young people the world is a far bigger place than just where they stay now.”  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
