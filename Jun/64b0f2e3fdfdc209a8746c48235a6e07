This followed after one 
person was killed and five others wounded when six men opened fire at the taxi rank
on Tuesday. Four taxi owners were among those shot in the incident that has been linked to ongoing violence over routes. Police yesterday acted  “proactively” and conducted a “high-density cordon off and search   operation” in the area. They issued traffic fines amounting to R200 000 for 
various offences and impounded 12 minibus taxis. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said the 
operation  resulted in a number of successful actions. Commenting on the attack and the police’s reaction, police management said: “This brazen attack on innocent people is a serious and direct threat to commuter safety and will not be tolerated. “Perpetrators of such heinous acts who have no regard for the lives and safety of the community will be met with decisive action on the part of  the SAPS. “There must be no doubt in the minds of these criminals that we will not rest until they have been brought to book. “We will respond vigorously and employ every legal method at our disposal to restore
commuter confidence and allow people to go about their daily business in safety.” Transport MEC Donald Grant said: “While we work closely with law enforcement agencies to tackle crime prevalent within the taxi industry, we have continued to explore and develop lasting solutions to stop the bloodshed.” He said his department
had been “working hard on sustainable solutions to this conflict’’.
