Mayco member for safety and security; and social services JP Smith said the province had recorded 132 cases, with 99 reported in the Cape Metro. “The City’s environmental health practitioners conduct routine assessments of informal traders. “When the recall was first issued, our environmental health practitioners visited informal sites to ensure the removal of recalled products. They found very little implicated product at these traders, and they were seen not to be a significant distributor,” Smith said. As part of ongoing vigilance, environmental health practitioners continue to monitor the formal and informal sector for any sale of the implicated products, and have undergone further training in dealing with outbreaks of this nature, added Smith. By the end of last month, 2670 tons of recalled Enterprise and Snax products had been destroyed, according to certificates provided by Department of Environmental Affairs officials. This includes products destroyed at exported destinations, according to the National Listeria Incident Management Team. One thousand and forty-nine confirmed cases have been reported from January 1 last year to June 5 this year. Seventy-six additional cases have been recorded since the recall. The management team’s report says the training of environmental health practitioners is almost complete, with 740 members trained in seven provinces.
