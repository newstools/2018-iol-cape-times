The video of the incident has since gone viral, eliciting outrage, and the two men have been identified. The SPCA said this week they were alerted to the video that depicted the horrific beating and stabbing of a baby seal. “We, as were many members of the public who saw the video on social media, were sickened at this blatant display of cruelty,” the SPCA said. On further investigation and with the help of concerned citizens, the SPCA identified the perpetrators. “As a result we have been able to gather enough evidence to lay charges in terms of the Animal Protection Act 71 of 1962 against Marius Tredoux, who is the man seen on the video abusing the seal. “Charges have also been laid against Rynard van der Heever who filmed the appalling scene. “The charges against Tredoux are obvious as he can be seen beating and hitting the baby seal, however Van der Heever is as guilty in terms of the act as he did nothing to stop the violent abuse.” The SPCA was confident justice would be served. It appealed to members of the public go to their local police station and make a statement, signed and stamped by the police, that requests of the court that the highest possible penalty be imposed at sentencing, in a further bid to strengthen their case. “It is imperative that this original copy is then posted to us for use during proceedings. “Help us get justice for this poor animal. We do not know what the fate of the seal was as it seems that the scene was filmed in December 2017.” The copies can be posted to: POBox 168, Darling, 7345. The SPCA said it had also come to their attention that individuals were soliciting for reward money. “We have not authorised anyone to do this on our behalf. “Reward money should be paid directly to the SPCA. The Swartland and West Coast SPCA is the only animal welfare organisation dealing with the case.”  For more information contact 0224922781 or e-mail Louise@swartlandwestcoastspca.co.za and Colette@Swartlandwestcoastspca.co.za.
