District Six Museum director Bonita Bennett said they wanted to create a space for people to have something to share without being too prescriptive about topic. “With things like Reclaim the City, Bo Kaap, and all things happening about how black people feel excluded in the city, we didn’t want to limit the conversation. “It’s about living in Cape Town and what your life has been like and what shaped you,” she said. On Fisher being a guest speaker, Bennett said: “He has an interesting story to tell. He is a thought leader around issues of race and diversity and has interesting ideas on how we can make Cape Town a better city. “He writes a weekly column and we want to hear how he arrives at stories he tells. He is also keen to speak of issues of race in the city.” Supper Club takes place on the last Thursday of every month and is in its third year. It is an opportunity to bring people together in conversation format, forming part of the museum’s “difficult dialogue” series. “It is intimate and centred on food which is an important cultural exchange,” Bennet said. “It goes back to community, hospitality where people can have a discussion, share their points of view in a friendly environment.” Tickets cost R150 and include a welcome drink, starter, main and dessert. Tickets can be purchased at Webtickets or through the museum Facebook page.
