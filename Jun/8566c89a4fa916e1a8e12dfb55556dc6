The fodder was donated by farmers in the North West province. “A few weeks ago, we got calls about the dire situation there, animals died and out of 153 farmers 11 had already been lost and 56 were in trouble,” said Gift of the Givers founder Imtiaz Sooliman. “We saw desperation in the farmer and where there’s need we respond, we don’t want to see people lose jobs. They can’t pay accounts, don’t have money to buy food. They can’t even fetch the free fodder. "If we can save a farm, save the sheep and save labourers. Out of 600 000 sheep, there’s only 125 000 left. Few died and they had to sell,” he said. He added with the current state of the economy, positive intervention to help businesses grow was necessary. All 200 boreholes in Sutherland dried out as the water levels dropped significantly. The Gift of the Givers drilling team arrived in the area yesterday with two rigs, and today 40 000 litres of diesel will be delivered to commence the drilling process. Sooliman said the process will be led by the organisation’s hydrologist, Dr Gideon Groenewald, and driller Martyn Landmann. Later in the week trucks will be collecting and delivering more fodder, as well as food parcels, blankets, hygiene packs and warm clothing for the farm labourers, the general population and schoolchildren (who will be provided with 5 000 specially formulated nutritious meals).
