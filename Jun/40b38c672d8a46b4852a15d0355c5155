Ward 3 and Ward 13 were won by the DA. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) released the results of the by-elections yesterday. In Saldanha Bay in Ward 3, the DA won and retained the seat it had won in the 2016 municipal elections, but with a reduced margin of 52.82% of the votes cast, compared to 69.99% in the 2016 municipal elections, according to the IEC. The ANC increased its margin from 24% to 39% in the ward in the same period. In Ward 13 in Oudtshoorn, the DA “retained the seat it won in the 2016 municipal elections, with a reduced margin of 50.59% of the votes cast compared to 60.19%”. The ANC increased its margin from 27% to 44% in the ward in the same period. There was also a slightly decreased turnout in the two by-elections, with 40.21% turning out in Saldanha Bay and 52.85% in Oudtshoorn. DA leader in the Western Cape Bonginkosi Madikizela admitted a reason for the drop in percentage of people voting for the party was, among other things, infighting in the Cape Town metro. Mayor Patricia de Lille’s job is on the line as the party has attempted many times to remove her as mayor though various platforms. “I am happy that we retained our wards in Saldanha and Oudtshoorn. Despite many prophets of doom who had written the DA off, we are still winning elections. "I am concerned that we decreased (the number of voters) from 2016, but I was not surprised given the challenges we are facing currently. "It just shows that once we deal with our challenges, we'll come back even stronger,” said Madikizela. ANC secretary Faiez Jacobs said it was to the ANC's advantage that the DA “has indeed lost all their 2016 gains, losing a whopping 10% of its voters compared to 2016”. He said the DA has been pushed back to their 2011 voter count. “This affirms the power of the new dawn and the positive impact of a renewing ANC in a space of five months,” he said.
