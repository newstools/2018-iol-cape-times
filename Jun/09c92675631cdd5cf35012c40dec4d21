Cape Town - Cape Town motorists have been warned of road closures along Jakes Gerwel Drive following cash-in-transit heist on Monday. The incident reportedly happened on Monday morning and saw a G4S cash van allegedly bombed along the busy road. It remains unclear how exactly the incident unfolded or if any arrests have been made, but the City of Cape Town has confirmed the closure of the road as a result of an incident. "Police incident, Jakes Gerwel Drive closed in both directions between Weltevreden and Turfhall Road," the city earlier said. Western Cape police have confirmed the incident, only saying there was an explosion involving a G4S vehicle while shots were also reportedly fired. Police are investigating and said a statement on the incident will be released during the course of the day.

Police Minister Bheki Cele later confirmed that 25 arrests have been made and that police were working hard to nab the masterminds behinds these crimes. IOL and ANA
