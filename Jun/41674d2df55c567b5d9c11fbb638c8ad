Johannesburg - The Johannesburg mayoral office on Monday confirmed that R275 000 was transferred to the City's account by the African National Congress (ANC). The city promised to seize the property of the ANC headquarters if it failed to settle over R300 000 in legal fees on Friday. Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba last week said: "This R300 000 belongs to the residents of this city. Either the ANC is unable to make this payment due to its own financial challenges or it is the result of the ANCâ€™s continuous and willful disregard for public money." "The days of the ANC being able to abuse public money in the City of Johannesburg are over and we will not hesitate to execute this court order should the ANC fail to make payment by Friday."
