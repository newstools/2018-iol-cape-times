The 17-year-old Symphony High School matric pupil is part of a team of young fighters from the Samurai Karate Matroosberg who have been chosen to represent South Africa at the 2018 19TH Kimura Shukokai International World Championships in Stockholm, Sweden. “Attending this event is very important to me. I want to make my family, community and country proud. "Ever since I was selected I was thinking about the only thing that can prevent me from achieving my dream, which is funds. I deserve a chance to defend my title and I have been training hard,” said Boonzaaier. In 2016 she was crowned the Unison Kata World Champion in Germany. She was ranked second in the world Kumite under 60kg as she bagged a silver medal. Boonzaaier was introduced to the sport by her late father who also participated in the sport from a young age. “At first I did the sport just for fun and because everyone at home participated in the sport. As time went by, I took it seriously and enjoyed it. “Look, now I’m a world champion and I know wherever my father is, he must be proud. I have started training already because during the winter season I might be at a winter school and have limited time to train.” Her sister, Louise Solomon, said Boonzaaier required R27 000 to participate at the tournament. “We are doing everything we can on our side to ensure she goes, but we know selling food and a raffle won’t be enough, hence we are requesting anyone who can assist to do so. “When she went to Germany in 2016 we were able to fund most of the things as my other sister was employed. Now I’m currently the only one working. We are all proud of her and know how much this means to her,” said Solomon. The tournament will take place from July 17 to 21. Anyone wishing to assist can contact Louise Solomon at 064 499 1988 or Pastor David Windvogel at 071 422 2988.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za
