George - The Western Cape DA has condemned the remarks made by George Mayor Melvin Naik on Heartbeat FM regarding the upcoming Boston Gay Choir Concert. Naik was on the station, and while on air said that it is "high time we take a stand (for) what is right". His remarks come following the planned concert by Boston Gay Men’s Chorus that is going to take place at the Conville Community Hall in George on the 19th of June. The concert is part of the group's national tour of South Africa. “I heard that it will go out under the banner of the George Municipality but as the Mayor of George Municipality I want to make this statement. This all due to my Christian conviction and belief system… it does not carry my approval, this concert,” Naik said.   “I am saying this without any judgment against anyone… no discrimination against anyone. This is only out of my Christian conviction and belief system that I am saying that I am not giving my approval to this concert here. All of us are equally made by God. All that I will do is bless these men and I will keep on praying for them.” The DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said that Naik's views do not represent the views of the party. "The concert is scheduled for the 19th of June in George and has been received with a lot of enthusiasm from the community. Concerts like the Boston Gay choir is good for the local economy as it provides people with jobs," Madikizela said. "No public representative of the DA can make a decision to exclude or discriminate against any member of our society based on his/her personal views. "The DA is a Party for all people irrespective of one’s sexual orientation. We reject unfair discrimination on any grounds and show solidarity with the LGBTI community." Madikizela added that the Federal Executive Chairperson, James Selfe, will be referring this matter to the Party’s Federal Legal Commission (FLC) for further investigation. @TheCapeArgus Cape Argus
