The municipality earlier this month met with interested parties to address concerns raised, and has committed to continue consultation with role players. Plett Tourism spokesperson Patty Butterworth said the main points of contention included that the municipality will control tourism through appointing a board and chairperson, and the board will then determine priority of spend after “consultation with tourism establishments”. The municipality, however, is not bound by advice from board or board members and is at liberty to allocate funds as it deems fit. (The by-law) compels establishments to register with a “tourist organisation” which must then discipline establishments, collect and hand over data and hand over levies to the municipality. The by-law also provides for “search and seizure” of premises and materials if non-compliance is suspected, and for fines and imprisonment if convictions follow. “Plett Tourism is however engaged with various stakeholders - business, tourism and political - across the spectrum and is confident a solution will be found that is in the interests of all who live and visit Plettenberg Bay,” Butterworth said. She said the body was already struggling with a lack of funding. “We are producing the Plett Arts Festival on a ‘bare bones budget’. If no additional funding is secured at the end of June, Plett Tourism staff will have to work without pay to see the festival to its end on July 9 Plett Tourism’s work is threatened,” she said. She called for Plett Tourism’s role as the independent, “tourism organisation” in Bitou to be reconfirmed and legitimised.
