Johannesburg - An African National Congress (ANC) MP was shot dead during a botched hijacking, the ruling party confirmed on Wednesday. Sibusiso Radebe, who served on the portfolio committee on transport, was shot in Roodepoort on Tuesday evening. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele confirmed that police had launched a manhunt for suspects linked to Radebe's murder. "Police have launched a search for two suspects believed to be responsible for the murder of a 40-year old male victim in Roodepoort, Johannesburg West. "Preliminary reports indicate that the deceased was with another person in a vehicle parked in Carbon Street, Lindhaven when two suspects allegedly approached the vehicle and opened fire, fatally wounding the deceased, while his companion managed to escape uninjured. The suspects then made off in a Ford Fiesta, dark in colour, with unknown registration. The motive is unknown and Makhubele confirmed that a police investigation is currently underway. ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu in a statement mourned Radebe's death and hailed him as a "dedicated servant" of the movement. "The ANC sends its deepest condolences to Radebe’s wife and his entire family. "May they find solace in the knowledge that we painfully share their loss and thank them for having borrowed the ANC and the country this incomparable servant of our people." Mthembu confirmed that the caucus was in the process of notifying all the relevant structures of Radebe’s passing and would make the necessary arrangements to visit the family. "We will keep South Africans informed about the memorial and funeral service arrangements once they have been finalised by the family," he said. IOL
