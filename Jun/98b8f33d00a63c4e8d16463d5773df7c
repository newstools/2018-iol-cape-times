Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said Anoyolo Maqashu’s mother left her with the 32-year-old Nodali and an 8-year-old child at about 8am. The child’s mother had gone to do shopping but when she came back a few hours later she found only the 8-year-old girl in the house. Anoyolo and Nodali “were nowhere to be found”. Rwexana said police interviewed Nodali’s boyfriend, who indicated that she had come to his house and collected all her clothing, then left. “The boyfriend mentioned that a day before the incident Sinovuyo requested money from him and he gave her the money,” said Rwexana. Nodali is from Tsolo in the Eastern Cape. “There is also a belief that 
she might go to Johannesburg,” Rwexana said. At the time of her disappearance Anoyolo was wearing a white romper and a blue towel. She is small with black curly hair and a small nose, and weighs 2 to 5kg. Police said the safety of children and crimes against women and children remained on top of the police’s list of priorities. Anyone with information about Nodali’s whereabouts is requested to contact Sergeant Mongi Ngedle at 
0782217817 or Gugulethu SAPS at 0216842300. Information can also be anonymously shared to Crime Stop at 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line at 32211.  sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.za
