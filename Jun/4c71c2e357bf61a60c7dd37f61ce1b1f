The two-day competition, at Durbanville High School, had a twist as for the first time the show included two PCA PRO divisions, bikini and bodybuilding along with standard amateur divisions. Last year, Sibango was rated No 1 at the Mpumalanga Championship in the physique athlete category. “Winning trophies for the men’s physique up to
175cm and overall men’s 
division physique was a big deal for me, because I 
have been working hard," he said. "But winning the PCA PRO meant my dream has came true. I am no longer an amateur but a professional bodybuilder. I will be able to participate in big international events." Sibango said he grew up enjoying trying to stay in shape, and was introduced to bodybuilding by someone he met at gym. “I had always looked 
after my body. I started out saying I’m doing it 
for fun, but now it’s more 
than that as young people 
in my township look up to me,” he said. Local professionals Wiehann Mentz and Roxanne McLachlan were among those who participated at the weekend's competition. The PCA is well known for providing athletes with an exceptional competitive experience. It was first formed in 
the US in 2015 with the objective of offering athletes an improved competitor experience. The organisation also announced their expansion locally, with PCA 
South Africa president 
Kevin Schwartz providing a platform for athletes to 
display their physiques.
