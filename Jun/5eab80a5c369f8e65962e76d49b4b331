In an internal circular, council chairperson Nogolide Nojozi said presentations from the candidates would take place between 9am and 11am at CPUTs Bellville campus. Dr Chris Nhlapo is acting in the position after former vice-chancellor Prins Nevhutalu resigned towards the end of last year after a disciplinary hearing found him guilty of gross misconduct. The university’s council had put Nevhutalu on special leave until March 31 last year, but he did not return to his position. A disciplinary hearing, chaired by an external independent chairperson was conducted and found Nevhutalu guilty. He had resigned before a sanction could be recommended by the independent external chairperson. Members of #FeesMustFall at CPUT accused Nevhutalu of corruption, purging students who raised the allegations and who were involved in protest action, refusing to insource services, sexual harassment, and refusing to write off student debt despite CPUT council’s request. University Student Representative Council chairperson Phathindwe Mcamase said he was involved in the selection committee and therefore could not comment on the process. Nojozi said: “Please note that only bona fide CPUT staff and students will be allowed into the venue. Therefore, all staff and students attending the event will be required to produce their valid staff or student cards at the entrance. Staff and students will be allowed to ask questions.”
