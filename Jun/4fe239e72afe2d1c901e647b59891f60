The drugs were found hidden inside an abandoned vehicle at a Westgate property at the weekend. This followed collaborative efforts by residents and sleuthing by the Hawks Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB). One person has been taken in for questioning after the significant bust at the Mitchells Plain home, and arrests are imminent. Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said the bust came after a joint operation by SANEB and a crime intelligence operation on Sunday led to the recovery of more than 11 bags of mandrax tablets, worth about R4.7m. A total of 106 000 mandrax tablets were seized and efforts are under way to trace the suspects as well as the owner of the property. Mitchells Plain CPF chairperson Abie Isaacs said they welcomed the bust in an area long considered a hot spot. “We are very happy about the recent bust. This area has been of concern for a long time due to lots of criminal activity,” he said. Police said they were clamping down across the province. They urged residents to share information that could lead to arrests.
