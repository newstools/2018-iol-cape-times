The 32-year-old mother was shot dead by her husband, Steven de Kock, 32, who turned the gun on himself at their Lotus River home. Their five-year-old son Daniel was in the house. On Thursday jokes and happy memories were shared to try and break the tense atmosphere and sombre mood that filled the packed school hall in Ottery. Pupils whose lives were touched by De Kock spoke highly of their “mother, father and pillar of strength”. Colleagues also spoke on how she had been respected in the education fraternity for her commitment and selfless contribution. A Grade 6 pupil, Zennidinne Jacobs, 11, recalled how he had been bullied as a newcomer who arrived midterm at the school. “I was the youngest in class and had the smallest body, so I was bullied a lot. I remember how teacher De Kock stood by me during my worst days and helped me to overcome bullying. With her extra efforts, I passed with good grades,” Zennidinne said.   Another pupil said: “My dad died tragically and I remember how she opened her arms and consoled me. Everyday she checked up on me and made me understand that he lives in me.” Her Grade 2 class and Unique Precious Seedlings (UPS), a group of female pupils who she mentored, paid tribute by singing songs of peace and hope. A large picture of her was placed between candles and a slide show of her and her son played on the side. De Kock's funeral will be on Sunday. Cape Times
