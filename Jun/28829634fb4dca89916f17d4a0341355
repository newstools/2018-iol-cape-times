Stacey, 6, whose body was found in a shallow grave at the weekend, was buried according to Islamic rites on Tuesday - a day after Christopher Brown, 25, was arrested. In court, State prosecutor Juwaya Kleinsmith confirmed the rape and murder charges brought against Brown. It emerged Brown had previously faced criminal charges, including illegally possessing a firearm, 
murder, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and crimen injuria. These charges were provisionally withdrawn. He allegedly buried Stacey in a shallow grave near his wendy house after she went missing on Saturday. Yesterday, Stacey’s mother, Sasha, was in tears when she saw Brown, her former boyfriend, step into the dock. The case was postponed to July 24 for a bail application. Kleinsmith said the State would be opposing bail. Stacey’s uncle, Lyle Daniels, the  spokesperson for the Adams family, said: “It will take a very long time for this wound to heal. We have a crack in our hearts at the moment because of this loss.” Daniels described Stacey as a vibrant child who crept deeply into their hearts. “We were like brother and sister. She was very close to us and just after her burial we spoke about her as if she was still around. The house has been very quiet without her.” Police had their work cut out for them when Mitchells Plain residents, eager to get a glimpse of Brown, tried to force their way into the packed courtroom. Proceedings were halted briefly for legal aid lawyer Naiema Herandien to consult with Brown, after a media application was received for photographs to be taken of her client. Herandien said Brown did not want his picture to be taken as he did not see the “relevance” of it. Magistrate Cathy Steyn granted permission for photographs to be taken, saying the case was of public interest.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
