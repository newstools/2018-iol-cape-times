Mahikeng - Former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo will head the provincial African National Congress (ANC) political school, he said on Friday. Mahumapelo told journalists in Mahikeng on the sideline of the swearing in of newly-elected North West premier Professor Job Mokgoro, that the ANC had given him the responsibility of establishing the provincial OR Tambo political school. "I will be heading the cadership programme of the ANC on full-time basis, thirdly I now have time to attend to my doctoral studies to complete them because I have not been having time."

Mahumapelo resigned as the premier on May 23, also resigned as a member of the provincial legislature (MPL) on Thursday,Â to make way for Mokgoro. He remains the provincial chairperson of the ANC in North West. He said the provincial executive committee would support the newly elected premier and called on people of the North West to focus on the new chapter and support Mokgoro. "We are happy as the ANC that indeed today we now have a premier and there is no longer a vacuum," he said. The ANC raced against time to appoint a premier after Mahumapelo's resignation about a month ago, and should they have failed to have a premier by Friday, the provincial government was going to be disbanded.
