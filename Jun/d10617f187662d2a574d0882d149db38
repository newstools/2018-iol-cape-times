Yesterday volunteers from the surrounding area and other groups came to assist the NGO in Athlone, in its quest to provide needy communities as Ramadaan nears its end. Fitrah is an obligatory annual tax (R40) towards feeding one person for a day at the end of Ramadaan. Sanzaf utilises this donation in order to ensure that underprivileged families have a hearty meal on Eid. Newly elected Sanzaf provincial manager Shafiek Barendse said there were several hamper packing locations in the province. “We started early this morning and we have been packing hampers to ensure families of up to five will have a festive meal this coming Eid and we have a goal of 3 000 hampers for today. “Fitrah is an essential part of our Muslim culture, and we are able to assist members of underprivileged communities and other programmes steered towards needy communities.” The organisation has urged the wider community to get involved and help them reach their target and join in their next fitrah hamper packing next week. Sanzaf aims to assist more than 23 000 families nationally on the day of Eid as part of Operation Fitrah. The goods being packed into hampers will be distributed to 18 000 families in the Western Cape, 3 750 families in Gauteng, more than 2 000 families in KwaZulu-Natal leaving the balance to be distributed in East London, Kimberley and Port Elizabeth. Gauteng regional manager Imtiaz Jhetam said: “It is vitally important that donors are not just involved to see how their fitrah was being utilised but to get involved with their families on the ground and help within needy communities. Fitrah goes towards national programmes, such as the hamper campaign as well as internationally as in regions of Africa where aid is needed.” Delft resident Shuraya Kamaldien said she had been involved with Sanzaf for the past nine years and encouraged everyone to get involved.
