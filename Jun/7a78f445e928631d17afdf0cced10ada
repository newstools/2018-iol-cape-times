The Alfie’s African Animals Colouring-in Book  was created by local author Tony Vroom, and encourages both creativity and literacy, with each page including a drawing of an animal, accompanied by a short story about the animal. Vroom said at the handover he was inspired to create the book by a 5-year-old boy, Alfie, who had spent most of his life in a children’s hospital due to medical complications. Alfie had a soft toy tiger, his favourite animal, and this spurred many conversations between the two about Africa’s great animals. It wasn’t long before Vroom bought a drawing pad and pen, and started creating the colouring-in book. “He is also a miracle child, and this prompted me to investigate whether the hospital would be interested in the colouring-in book. “For me the journey lies in what the book can hopefully achieve - providing children with some fun and creativity and a little knowledge about the wildlife of Africa that should remain precious to all of us,” said Vroom. Chief executive of the hospital Matodzi Mukosi said: “Not only will this donation brighten the lives of our young patients, but it will also assist with their rehabilitation and treatment. “We are sincerely grateful and humbled by this donation.” Long-time sponsor of the hospital Pick *  Pay facilitated the printing of the books, and about 1000 packs of BIC® Kids Colouring Wax Crayons were donated to the hospital so the children could bring their drawings to life.
