The carcade procession through the town gave locals an opportunity to see 23-year-old medical student in person who they supported as she began her reign three weeks ago. The event on Youth Day  saw Drakenstein Municipality mayor Conrad Poole escorting Green into the hall, where she was greeted with a standing ovation. Green said she was overwhelmed by the support she had received thus far during her three-week reign. “I think it is only now sinking in and I have been blessed and tremendously honoured through the support and love I have received from my home town. “During the speech at the gala dinner I emphasised that I want to use my story to encourage other young people to use their own struggles and backgrounds to overcome adversity,” she said. Green said that with the blessing of her institution, UCT, she had postponed her final year medical studies
but would return later to
specialise as a paediatrician. She would be immersing herself in her role as an ambassador and would be launching her own initiatives later this year in a bid to make a positive change in the lives of South Africa’s youth. Green, accompanied by her family and close friends, took selfies with locals, and the guests were entertained by local performers. Poole  said: “From the day I met Tamaryn, I just knew she would wear the crown one day. “I am convinced more titles are on the way for her,” Poole added. He encouraged the youth of Drakenstein to “dream big”.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
