In a moving ceremony Community Chest Siyakubona (We See You) campaign surprised the Samurai Karate Matroosberg group from Belhar by announcing they would cover all outstanding costs to the tournament. The group were in the process of withdrawing from the event due to lack of funding. Among the group is Youth Unison Kata World Champion and the second ranked in the world for Kumite under 60kg, Edwina Boonzaaier. The Cape Times had reported about her fundraising campaign in an effort to participate. Touched by her plight, the Community Chest decided to surprise her and fellow fighters on Friday. The organisation will cover all outstanding fees required and invest R50 000 into their club each year to benefit more students. https://www.facebook.com/CapeTimes/videos/1826870130704113/ The organisation also announced that for the next three years they will offer study bursaries towards their higher education in any university provided they do not quit the club. The donations form part of Community Chest’s 90th celebrations. The Samurai Karate Matroosberg houses children from mainly disadvantaged backgrounds.They cannot afford to study further after matric and some are raised by family members because they don’t have parents. Emotional pastor David Windvogel, who is their coach, said the last time he was so overwhelmed was when he was told his daughter born seven months early was going to survive. Edwina’s sister Louise Solomon said: “I felt like a burden had been taken off. I guess the saying at the end of the tunnel there is light is true. We thank God for sending Community Chest. When we counted how many weeks we had left we saw it was impossible to reach the target and we gave up. I am just speechless.”
