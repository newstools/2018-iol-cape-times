It has attributed the fare increase from Monday to the ongoing massive price increases at the fuel pumps. The Automobile Association predicted a 24c-a-litre increase for petrol and 26c-a-litre for diesel next month. Gabs spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said fuel prices had risen by 30% over the past year, “and they are projected to escalate by a further 6% next month”. “The contract between Gabs and the Western Cape Provincial Department of Transport and Public Works makes 
provision for adjustments 
to bus fares to offset the 
effect of increased operational expenses. “The 3.7% increase in operational subsidies for public transport also failed to keep abreast of cost escalations. Despite these challenges we have limited the fares increase to 5% across the board.” Dyke-Beyer said commuters could postpone paying the increased fares until July 15 in the case of 10-ride clip cards valid for 14 days, and until August 7 in the case of monthly clip cards valid for 37 days, if purchased before the effective date. The last increase was a 7% price hike at the end of December last year. GO GEORGE also reminded its passengers that the annual increase in the price of the bus tickets kicks in next week Tuesday and that trips on the multi-journey tickets must be used before the end of the month. The George Municipality said the annual increase in the price of GO GEORGE bus tickets was part of the annual municipal tariff adjustments. The green single ticket bought at vendors would cost 50c (R10). The price of the grey single ticket bought on the bus will increase by R2 to R12. National Taxi Alliance spokesperson Theo Malele also warned taxi commuters to brace themselves for fare increases, blaming the fuel increases and subsidy. He said taxi fares would not go up overnight, but would gradually increase to give
commuters time to adjust.
