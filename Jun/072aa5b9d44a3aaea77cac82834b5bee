No one was injured, said Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott, and the cause of the fire and estimates of damage will be assessed during post-incident investigations. Rewards of up to R25 000 are payable for information leading to successful convictions, Scott said. Fire and emergency rescue services safely evacuated commuters from the train. The incident resulted in the Simon’s Town trains from Cape Town terminating at Retreat train station;  trains then operated on a single line between Retreat and Fish Hoek. Bus shuttle services were used to ferry commuters between Fish Hoek and Simon’s Town. “Final mopping-up operations will commence as soon as forensic teams have completed their investigation,” Scott said. She said the damaged carriages would be taken to the depot for further investigation and assessment by Prasa loss adjusters. “Anyone with information or footage of the event is requested to provide this to police. All reports will be investigated and treated in strictest confidence,” said Scott. The incident came less than a month after another Metrorail train was set alight near Ottery station, which resulted in the death of one person and four others injured. Arson was suspected in this incident. Anyone with information should contact Metrorail Protection Services hot-line at 0214494336/5056 or police at 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line 32211.
