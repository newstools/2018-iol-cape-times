Cape Town - Western Cape police have confirmed the death of three people at a mosque in Malmesbury in the early hours of Thursday morning. “Malmesbury police were called out to a local mosque and found two people stabbed to death and several others injured,” police spokesperson Andre Traut said. He said that the suspect who is believed to be in his late thirties was armed with a knife and still on the scene “Police tried to persuade him to hand himself over. He ignored the calls and tried to attack police,” Traut said. In the process, police shot and killed him.
