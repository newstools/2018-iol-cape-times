The march, which took place in major cities across the country including Durban and Johannesburg, was supported by the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa). As much as 200 marchers handed a memorandum to 
Premier Helen Zille. Some of their grievances were addressed to the South African Reserve Bank, the Department of Transport, the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and the Department of Community Safety. The marches yesterday followed a spike in the number of cash-in-transit related robberies across the country. The parliamentary portfolio committee on police is today expected to have a discussion on the intelligence and operational readiness of police to combat the robberies, discuss co-operation with the security industry, state of training vehicles and protective gear of security officers, regulatory environment and technological innovations to curb the incentives to engage in cash-in transit heists. Tarzan Mbila said it was unfortunate that innocent cash-in-transit guards and drivers were paying the price. “The people robbing us are well equipped with information, as they know exactly where we will be at what 
time. "They don’t ask questions but use automatic rifles, including AK-47s and hand grenades. Our lives are at risk on a daily basis,” said Mbila. “Where are these syndicates accessing explosives 
from?”Fedusa general secretary Dennis George said he hoped the demands of the workers will be addressed. “The police have got a responsibility to apprehend the perpetrators. We have had enough of our members being killed,” said George. Accepting the memorandum, Zille said: “The issues you raised are very, very serious indeed and are entirely legitimate. “The number of cash-in-transit heist has grown. Your lives and the lives of innocent bystanders are generally at risk."  sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.za
