The search-and-seizure operation was conducted at, among others,  the Langeberg Municipality’s Kommando Building in Robertson, Thusang Disaster Recovery Site in Robertson, Callie De Wet Sportsentrum in Robertson, Langeberg Tourism offices, the Langeberg Municipality building in Ashton, a private business and about 15 private residences. Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said following allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and contraventions of the Municipality Finance Management Act, the unit  took action after “alleged interference by officials, who apparently removed potentially incriminating documents from municipal offices to private homes”.
No arrests had been made. Thembani Mgoqi, of Cope’s Langeberg sub-region, said the party had reported the allegations to Local Government MEC Anton Bredell in April, but he had “turned a blind eye”. However, Local Government spokesperson James-Brent Styan said the Western Cape government “always welcomes the Hawks into our councils in the interest of good governance”.
