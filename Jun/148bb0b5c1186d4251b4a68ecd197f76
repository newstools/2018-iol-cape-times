Johannesburg - Suspended SA Revenue Service (SARS) boss Tom Monyane will not be prosecuted at this stage for allegedly assaulting the teenage mother of his grandson, it was reported on Friday. This was because the investigating team needed more time to consider all the facts, EWN has reported. The news site further said that Moyane had been informed of South Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions Andrew Chauke's decision. It is unclear if the victim's family has also been informed. Earlier, a legal representative of the victim, Brighton Hlayisani, from BH Taula Attornies said: "From the information that we received from the DPP [The Director of Public Prosecutions]office is that the docket was before the court on Monday. "They have advised that police must do further investigations and once that is done they will proceed with the matter, but at this stage we don't know when that will be," said Hlayisani.
