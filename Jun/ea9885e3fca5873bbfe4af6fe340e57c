Lekisha Aliza Wilschut’s body, concealed in a dilapidated old Transnet building, was found by a passer-by who was searching for his missing horses on June 14. Police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie said initial reports indicated the girl was last seen alive at her parents’ home on May 25, but was only reported missing on May 28. The case has since been handed over to the Beaufort West family violence, child protection and sexual offences (FCS) unit. “An autopsy was conducted, where preliminary reports indicate that she was murdered. As such, we opened a murder docket for further investigation. No one has been arrested, although all possible clues are being investigated,” he said. Pojie has urged the public to come forward with any information and to contact 023 414 8800/25 or Crime Stop at 0860010111. Meanwhile, a Kuils River family have been squatting on the doorstep of the Wellington police station since Tuesday in hopes of finding missing 21-year-old Chantelle Matthyssen. Matthyssen, a single mother to a three-year-old boy, went in search of a job in the Winelands town. Police spokesperson André Traut said Matthyssen went missing from her home in Jupiter Street in Kuils River on June 23. “It is believed that she went to Wellington for a work opportunity and contacted her mother to say that she had arrived. She has since failed to contact her mother again. At the time of her disappearance she was wearing blue jeans and a black hoodie,” Traut said. Matthyssen’s mother, Carol Petersen, said she became suspicious when her daughter did not contact her again shortly after arriving in Wellington, where the family friend picked her up.
