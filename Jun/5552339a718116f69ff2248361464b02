The organisation has drafted an alternative proposal, which shows the site could be used for between 114 and 171 affordable housing units at a three-storey building. Acting mayoral committee member for assets and facilities management Suzette Little said a process for the renewal of the bowling green's lease had started, and would include consultation with other City departments. “The process will involve an inclusive public participation, which will include a call for alternative proposals before the report is submitted to the sub-council for comment and the decision-making authority for consideration,” Little said. Ndifuna Ukwazi said Fish Hoek was one of the most segregated suburbs in Cape Town, and leasing the site at a nominal rate to “elite, mostly white sports associations instead of using it for transformation and redress, and to advance spatial justice” was unacceptable. “Fish Hoek is highly segregated and is still majority white (81%), Masiphumelele is black (89%) and Ocean View is coloured (91%). This segregation has a profound effect on livelihoods and access to services and opportunities. Masiphumelele has a population density of 40597/km2, Ocean View 7734/km2 and Fish Hoek just 883/km2,” Ndifuna Ukwazi said. They added that the City was failing to proactively identify and use its own land in former white areas to desegregate the city. The organisation said the public participation process was in fact completed.
