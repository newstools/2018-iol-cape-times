Following a tip-off, police spokesperson Andrè Traut said they searched a primary school in Rocklands where the 57-year-old was staying. They found two unlicensed firearms and an assortment of drugs with an estimated street value of R513660. “Our efforts to address gang-related crime in affected areas in the Western Cape have led to the arrest of a suspect with possible links to a notorious Cape Flats gang,” Traut said. Western Cape Education Department (WCED) spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said the staffer, employed by the school governing body, had been working there for the past two years. “The news has shocked the school management, who 
evidently did not suspect that the staff member was involved in illegal activities. “It is very concerning that such items were found on the grounds of one of our schools. Our schools are weapon- and drug-free zones. “The WCED is thankful to the SAPS for the arrest, and for removing the illegal substances and weapons from the school’s grounds,” Hammond said. Western Cape Police Commissioner Khombinkosi Jula congratulated his officers on their efforts. Meanwhile, another tip-off led to the arrest of a 25-year-old woman for being in possession of tik and mandrax with a street value of R3million  in Vukayi Street, Lwandle, Strand. “The suspect was arrested for dealing in drugs, and she is scheduled to make a court appearance in Strand once she has been charged,” Jula said. He commended the officers on the arrest.
