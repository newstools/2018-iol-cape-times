Salga represents municipalities and their entities. This comes after three rounds of negotiations, in which the facilitator presented a three-year proposal to be considered which includes a 7% wage increase and housing allowance, among others. The proposal would have taken effect from July this year. Both the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (Imatu) and Salga accepted the facilitator’s proposal. Samwu general-secretary Simon Mathe said the negotiators at the bargaining council were seemingly determined on imposing the facilitator’s report “down the throat of Samwu”. Mathe said after consulting their members the proposal was “vehemently rejected” as “it does not address the financial situation which municipal workers find themselves in”. He said workers were demanding a single year agreement of 15%, a R2000 housing allowance and a R10000 minimum wage. Salga’s spokesperson Sivuyile Mbambato said Samwu “has not provided reasons for rejecting the facilitator’s proposal or taken the parties into confidence as to why they rejected the proposal 
when they were party to its conception”. Imatu general secretary, Johan Koen said: “Our negotiators are always mindful of the growing financial pressure faced by members, including the VAT and fuel levy increases, as well as increases in the cost of living.”
