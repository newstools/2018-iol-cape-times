The containers the NGO currently uses for their various activities are dilapidated and unsafe for the 150 children who interact in their programmes. Matthew Blackman from GYD said the property from which they were operating was owned by a company which had been in liquidation for three years. “We have made an offer to purchase the property, which recently has been accepted. The property, due to the liquidation process, has become close to derelict. We are looking for funding to build a gym and classrooms. “However, as an interim stopgap this winter we would like to purchase a new container classroom and restore an ablutions facility,” he said. Blackman said they were assisting the Makhaza area bordering Stellenbosch, but it was their dream to expand and uplift children from other communities. GYD began in 2007 under the name Grassroots Boxing Academy. Founder Jongi Kamko, a local boxing coach, decided to devote his life to helping others after his professional boxing career was cut short when he nearly lost his legs due to an infection.   “The boxing instruction and mentorship provided by Jongi, along with social support from peers at the gym, acted to keep kids focused and away from the violence in the streets,” said Blackman. ‘‘The GYD focuses on improving the fitness, education and diet of children from five to 18 years old. Jongi saw a need to provide local schoolchildren with a healthy alternative to the culture of drugs and gangs that are a reality in the area. ‘‘We provide boxing, cycling and fitness training as well as tuition classes every Saturday morning and Wednesday night. Blackman said they welcomed any help with building the gym and classrooms and in acquiring a new container.
