The suspects were arrested on Monday after they allegedly hijacked a vehicle and killed the occupants, said police spokesperson Andre Traut. He said the suspects were found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. “Three armed suspects approached two occupants of a Toyota double-cab bakkie on the corners of Labelle and Watts roads in Brackenfell and opened fire on them. Both men, aged 25 and 40, were killed. “The suspects fled the scene in a VW Polo and were followed by the SAPS members who witnessed the incident. "Following a high-speed pursuit which ended in J Block, Khayelitsha, all three suspects, aged 28, 35 and 46, were arrested with the assistance of members attached to Khayelitsha SAPS.” Four 9mm firearms, of which three are unlicensed, as well as various calibre rounds of ammunition, were confiscated from the suspects. “The possibility that the murders are linked to the taxi industry is not ruled out. Once charged, the suspects are due to make a court appearance to face the charges against them.” Provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula commended his members for their vigilance which led to the speedy arrests. Congress for Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta) spokesperson Andile Khanyi said although taxi violence incidents had decreased, they commended police for their intent to conduct a thorough investigation. “We definitely support police in their bid to combat crime and jail criminals threatening our livelihoods. "Threats on black-owned businesses are condemned and we definitely do not want to see any of it in the taxi industry.”
