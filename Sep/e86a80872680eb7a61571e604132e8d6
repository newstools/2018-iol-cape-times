A nervous-looking Fayrooz Saleh appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court on Friday for allegedly boarding a flight at OR Tambo International Airport with US dollars to the value of nearly R10 million in her hand luggage. The 22-year-old student intends to plead guilty to failing to declare the cash, TimesLive reported. If her guilty plea is accepted‚ the court could order that she pay a fine that could amount to treble the value of the goods she failed to declare or that she serve jail time not exceeding two years. Saleh‚ believed to be from Ennerdale in Johannesburg‚ also faces a charge suggesting the cash may be the proceeds of a crime. The State alleged that she took the money knowing it was obtained unlawfully. She has no previous convictions or pending bail matters. At the time of her arrest, SA Revenue Service spokesperson Sicelo Mkosi said in a statement the money amounted to $630 700. The cash had been packed in $50 and $100 bundles in a plastic bag. Saleh's flight to Hong Kong was scheduled to leave last week Tuesday when the officers apprehended her. "Initially, she denied having currency in her possession, but after further questioning, she admitted that she had a substantial amount of money in her backpack," Mkosi said. He said she was taken to the customs search area, where she was placed in an interview room and asked to complete a traveller card. "The passenger verbally stated that she had 650 000 United States dollars in her bag. She admitted that she was not the owner of the currency, nor could she supply any proof of ownership," Mkosi said.
