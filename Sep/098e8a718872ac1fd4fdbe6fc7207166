The findings, which were released to coincide with World Environmental Health Day on September 26, have also revealed that the country uses over 750% more energy than Zimbabwe. Trinidad and Tobago uses more energy per person than anywhere else and only 0.23 per cent of which is green. The research shows Britain has a greener population than France, Germany and the United States, but only ranks 53rd on the list. Countries such as Mozambique, Ethiopia and Zambia use almost 100 per cent green energy from local hydropower.

Top 'green' countries include Ethiopia, Zambia, Latvia and Kenya. "Adopting green energy on an individual level can be difficult or expensive. But a more practical approach for someone looking to reduce their effects on the climate can turn their attention instead to their waste production, and what they do with that waste," said Kaizen Search Marketing.
