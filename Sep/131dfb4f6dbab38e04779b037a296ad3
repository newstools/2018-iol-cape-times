Public transport commuters struggled on Tuesday to get around following the closure of the Bellville taxi rank and the end to the struggle is not yet in sight. To make matter worse, a number of roads were closed across the city during the #TotalShutdown protests, leaving some stuck in congestion for hours. Yesterday, public order police were at various locations, including Bellville, where a taxi route-related shooting injured innocent commuters. The Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) said the Bellville taxi rank will stay closed indefinitely or until the Bellville Taxi Association (Bellta) and Bloekombos-Wallacedene Taxi Association (Bloewata) can reach an agreement over routes. The closure of the rank was separate to the protestÂ and was a result of a shooting between the rival groups last week that ended with two innocent commuters being wounded and needing medical attention. Cata spokesperson Andile Seyamo said the association was working to resolve the dispute so that commuters could once again use the major interchange. Seyamo could not be reached for comment yesterday and no updates on the progress of the discussion have been received, nor has the association given commuters alternatives.
