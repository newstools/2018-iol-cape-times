The Swartberg Pass near Oudtshoorn in the Little Karoo has been closed due to snowfall. Snow has also fallen in the Langkloof near Uniondale and on the Outeniqua Mountains at George, the SABC reported on Friday. Garden Route Disaster Management chief Gerhard Otto says good rainfall has also been experienced in the region since early Friday morning. According to Otto, the highest reading recorded is 40 millimetres at Tsitsikamma. Otto said they are closely monitoring the situation. "Fortunately, we've had no areas that had to be evacuated due to flooding. We're monitoring our estuaries. Normally our protocol is to do preparatory channels, so if needed we can drain the estuaries," saidÂ Otto. "These preparatory channels have already been put in place by the Mossel Bay Municipality at the Great Brak (River), SANParks (South African National Parks) at the Touw River and also working on the Swartvlei, so these are all being monitored."
