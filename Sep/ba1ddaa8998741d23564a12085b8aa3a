Stealing nine cans of the energy drink Red Bull from Checkers has landed a man three-month suspended sentence in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Thursday. "I don't know what got into me your worship," said the apologetic man, who opted to speak for himself and pleaded guilty immediately, News24 reported. He told Magistrate S Mthimunye he had been looking for work and went to Checkers in Rondebosch on August 6 to buy a bun to eat. On the spur of the moment, he put the tins in his trolley. He planned to sell them to cover his job-hunting costs and only paid for the bun. But the security guard nabbed him as he wheeled out the goods, worth R191, without paying. In mitigation of his sentence, the 28-year-old man, who was neatly dressed in a jacket and tie, said his mother died in 2002 and he and his brother were struggling. Mthimunye noted that he already had a previous conviction for stealing something worth R3 000 earlier this year. She sentenced him to three months in prison, suspended for five years. Another man in the same court pleaded guilty on Thursday to stealing an Orlando Pirates T-shirt from Totalsports in Cavendish Square. He had 12 convictions, mainly for theft or related to drugs, and also pleaded guilty straight away without the help of a lawyer. Mthimunye sentenced him to three months in prison.
