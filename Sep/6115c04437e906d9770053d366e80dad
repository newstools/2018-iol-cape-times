Cape Town - A loving father, who worked as an administration clerk at the Mitchells Plain Day Hospital, has been shot and killed while sitting in his car. Mogamat Noer Adams, 35, of Bridgetown was attacked in Conrad Street, Ottery, on Wednesday night, while collecting a car part, according to his family. Gunmen in a car opened fire on his gold Toyota Corolla before driving off. Noer was shot twice and four other bullets hit the vehicle. Noer, who has a 12-year-old son from a previous relationship, had been working at the Mitchells Plain Day Hospital as an administration clerk for six years. Relatives on Thursday described him as a humble and kind-hearted person. Speaking shortly before his janaazah on Thursday his wife of three years, Faeda, says he had come home after completing a shift at Tafelsig Clinic where he was helping out for the day. “He was on duty on Wednesday at one of their off-site facilities,” explains Faeda. “‘He left the house after maghrib (sunset prayers) and he was on his way to fetch a car part. It (the shooting) happened while he was waiting in the car.” The grieving wife broke down and was consoled by family members who were all in tears. A family member, who asked not to be identified, says Noer was a humble person and they do not know why he was targeted. “We are in complete shock,” she says. “He was a father of a 12-year-old boy and he worked at the hospital since 2012. “He was the type of person who would go out of his way for people and he loved the elderly. “We cannot believe this because he wasn’t a gangster but a family man.” Police spokesman, Constable Wesley Twigg, says the motive behind the attack is under investigation. “The suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested. Anyone with any information about this fatal shooting incident can contact Grassy Park SAPS on 021 700 3900 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” Twigg says. Daily Voice
