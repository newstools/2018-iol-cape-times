The Metro Police Gang and Drug Task Team made two quick arrests in Beacon Valley late on Tuesday afternoon, thanks to tip-offs from the public. Just after 5pm, officers acted on information received about drug dealing at an address in Rugby Street. They recovered 40 bankies of dagga and just over R5 000 in cash, and arrested a 36-year-old suspect, believed to be a gang member, the City of Cape Town said. "An hour later, officers acted on another tip-off and arrested a 49-year-old man for possession of eight packets of tik at a house in Jukskei crescent, in the same neighbourhood. "The Metro Police Department thanks the public for their help in making these arrests possible. The suspects were detained at Mitchells Plain SAPS and will appear in court soon," the City said. The City's Safety and Security Directorateâ€™s annual statistics for the 2017/18 financial year recently highlighted a significant increase in tip-offs from the public leading to arrests.
