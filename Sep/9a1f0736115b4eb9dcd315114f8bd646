Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the motive behind the shooting was yet to be determined “The death of a 28-year-old male is being investigated after he was shot and killed in 11th Avenue, Kensington, by an unknown suspect who is yet to be arrested.” Hundreds of fed-up residents were joined by religious leaders in yet another solidarity march. Zainulabideen van der Schyff, secretary of the Kensington Street Committee, said there was a huge improvement after the deployment of seven police officers in November and December. “The problem started again when there were few men on the ground, which is the result of a number of police officers who were removed from our station and deployed elsewhere. "We took to the streets because last year we did the same thing and things normalised, as we received the police resources we needed,” said Van der Schyff. Van der Schyff said they will write to the provisional police commissioner and to Parliament. He said they appealed to Minister of Police Bheki Cele to visit the area. Residents also want a satellite police station to be added to the community. Anyone with information about the shooting can contact Crime Stop on 086 0010 111 or Crime Line on 322111. Cape Times
