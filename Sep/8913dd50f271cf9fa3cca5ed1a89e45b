Tomorrow, the foundation, along with people around the world, will unite to fight cardiovascular disease (CVD) by holding awareness activities and events, spreading the word on social media, sharing the campaign’s video, organising fund-raising activities for their heart foundation and illuminating iconic landmarks, buildings or monuments. Heart and Stroke Foundation chief executive Pamela Naidoo said: “The foundation is very fortunate to have institutions and partners around South Africa who share the passion to reduce CVD.” This year the World Heart Federation is raising awareness of the strong link between poor air quality and CVD. Nearly one in five deaths from the disease are caused by air pollution. Outdoor and household air pollution are an increasingly important risk factor for CVD. According to recent research, air pollution is the cause of 19% of all deaths from the disease, accounting for more than 3million each year. The latest scientific evidence has also warned that exposure to nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter air pollution, originating from household wood, coal burning, industrial facilities, vehicle emissions and agricultural burning, is clearly linked to CVD mortality. WHF President, David Wood, said: “We are bringing together all those involved in cardiovascular health from every country in the world in the fight to reduce CVD.”
