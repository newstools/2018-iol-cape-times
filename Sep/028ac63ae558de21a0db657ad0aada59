Emmanuel, of Parow, was announced the winner of the SA Junior Maths Olympiad 2018 at an awards event in Stellenbosch at the weekend, much to the surprise of his father who thought he would not be in the right frame of mind due to the passing of the teen’s mother. She died on Mother’s Day - three days before the final round of competition. Emmanuel completed against 100 000 junior and senior school pupils from across the country. “She would never have wanted me to give up - she fought her illness till the very end and taught me the meaning of courage,” said Emmanuel. He pledged to donate his prize-money, which he won with an iPad, to a worthy educational cause working to support such outreach programmes that he and peers from his school participated in, in the Eastern Cape. Emmanuel said he would use any platform to raise more funds for underprivileged children. “Our motto at SACS is Spectemur Agendo (let us be judged by our deeds). “I thank God for giving me the courage to get through this competition, my teacher for inspiring me, and I now would like to help make a small difference in the lives of other school kids who desperately need it.” Emmanuel said he would like to meet South African entrepreneur and Tesla and Space X chief executive Elon Musk. He also wishes he could see his mother, to tell her one final time how much he loved her.
