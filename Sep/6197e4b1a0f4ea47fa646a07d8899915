The brand-new Gouda educare centre will open its doors on Saturday for the 78 children enrolled from the Drakenstein region. Its launch coincides with the International Literacy Day and is funded by the Gouda Wind Energy Facility and project-managed by the Centre for Early Childhood Development (CECD). Literacy is a human right, an essential tool in realising peace, promoting democracy, eradicating poverty, achieving gender equality and ensuring sustainable development. The foundation phase of early childhood development has increasingly become a point of focus, setting the tone for a child’s academic progress. The CECD is committed to ensuring quality care and education for young children, working with disadvantaged communities to enhance their skills and capacity in ECD services, using a developmental, sustainable, respectful and empowering approach. The Gouda wind farm is situated just outside the town, which at 138MW is one of the largest wind farms in southern Africa. Started in early September 2015, the project cost R2.7 billion and at the time of its completion was the largest wind farm in the Western Cape. The educare centre, established in 1992, was based at the New Apostolic Church until the end of 2014, before being relocated to its current premises. The initial centre run by the principal, Ellen van Wyk, had one Nutec building and two formal wooden structures with a leaking roof and holes in the wall. The new centre comes equipped with indoor education toys and materials, an office, toilets, a kitchen and a hall that has been promised to be available to the Gouda community for use. There is also a large outdoor play area with equipment enabling children to learn new skills in a safe, stimulating environment.
