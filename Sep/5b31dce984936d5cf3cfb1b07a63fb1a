The clean-up drive facilitated by the Shoprite Group came on the back of the retail group staging Africa's biggest clean-up in July in which 12 000 volunteers participated in 465 clean-up events in 12 countries in the world. “Our objective is clear: we want to start a movement in which volunteers commit to regularly cleaning their environment. World Clean-up Day was a great initiative to rally around to give further momentum to this movement, kick-started by Africa's biggest clean-up,” said Lunga Schoeman, CSI spokesperson for the Shoprite Group. In Cape Town, no fewer than 335 Shoprite managers attending the group's annual Christmas Expo, some coming from as far afield as Ghana and Nigeria, got their hands dirty to keep the Mother City clean. The Gatesville Neighbourhood Watch also joined volunteers in cleaning up the area and Rylands CBD area. Environmentalist and clean-up champion Refilwe Mofokeng organises monthly coastal clean-ups in the Durban area. World Clean-up Day is also International Coastal Clean-up Day, which prompted her to organise a clean-up of the Durban Harbour. She founded NGO Refilwe Matlotlo (Refilwe's treasure) to educate people about the importance of keeping our oceans clean. Mofokeng partnered with Girls and Boys Town and also enlisted the help of volunteers from the University of KwaZulu-Natal. She said volunteers received training before the clean-up while Durban Solid Waste “ensured that all recyclables are recycled so that as little as possible goes to landfills”.
