The Cannons Creek Independent School teacher has been suspended. Principal Mike van Haght said pupils and unhappy parents reported the incident, saying they were offended and felt that was a racial remark. The school held auditions for Fiddler on the Roof last week, and one of the families in the play are White Russians. The teacher reportedly said to some pupils auditioning that they were only looking for children of a fairer skin. “Well, we weren’t actually looking for that, we were prepared for a mixed-race family,” Van Haght said. “That obviously caused a lot of confusion. Pupils and parents were hurt. I was notified the next morning, and we instantly cleared things by informing the pupils that we were not only casting fair-skinned pupils. “The teacher admits the words but said them unintentionally. Although it was insensitive, which there is no doubt to it, I believe she didn’t intentionally mean any malice or harm. "She has also made an unreserved apology to the pupils,” said Van Haght. He said parents of pupils both in the primary and high schools were aware of the suspension because letters were sent out to inform them. Cape Times
