 A medical condition was blamed for the man who, gun in hand, sowed panic at Capitec's administrative office this week appearing disoriented in the Bellville Regional Court on Friday. Facing charges of the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition and resisting arrest, News24 reported that a gaunt-looking Bevan Abrahams was wearing a creased T-shirt under his hoodie, holding his face in his hands and swaying slightly. "Is he okay?" a concerned magistrate asked. His attorney, Kirvin Adams, submitted that his client had a medical condition and had been given his medication late. On Wednesday afternoon, the Capitec administrative office in Voortrekker Road was evacuated as police tried to negotiate with a gunman who had apparently threatened staff and locked himself in. Abrahams's lawyer told News24 outside court that he could not confirm or deny a report in Die Son that Abrahams was upset about an investment that an ex-girlfriend allegedly removed from his account. Prosecutor Clifford Moatlhodi told the court that bail was not opposed at this stage. Abrahams will remain in custody until his bail application, but the magistrate instructed that he be kept in the hospital section of prison until then. She also instructed that he be taken to a district surgeon for a medical examination.
