They are now able to perform simple daily tasks using their voice to “wake up” their Voice-Activated Quality of Life (VoQol) system, known as Alexa. Lowri Williams, programme manager at the QuadPara Association Western Cape (QAWC) said: “To our knowledge, this is the first installation at a residential facility in Africa. "It may seem like a small thing that we take for granted, to switch off the fan when the room reaches the right temperature, but for someone who is physically disabled from the shoulders down, VoQol gives them a new level of autonomy. “The completion of such a project really demonstrates how we can assist quadriplegics and paraplegics to reach their full potential.” The technology relies on wi-fi and can be used to control the sound or channels on a TV, switch on a fan or a light, and call for assistance.   Anthony Ghillino, general manager of QAWC who is a C4 quadriplegic (paralysed from the shoulders down) said: “I can get a cricket update and 20 seconds later switch back to what I was watching, which sounds insignificant, but it makes a big difference in my life.” With the first phase of the project successfully completed, QAWC are seeking funding to install more devices at Eric Miles Cheshire Home where 32 residents do not have access to the technology yet.
