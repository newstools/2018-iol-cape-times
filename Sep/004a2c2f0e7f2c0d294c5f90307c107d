A man from Bishop Lavis was shot and killed around 11am on Friday, Western Cape police say. "This morning at around 11:00 an adult male from Bishop Lavis was shot and killed in Voortrekker Road in Kensington by unknown suspects who fled the scene in a white Mercedes Vito," Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut told News24. Police are still investigating the circumstances around the incident. Eyewitness News earlier reported that the man was a passenger on a bus that was on the way to Maitland cemetery. "Golden Arrow can confirm a fatal shooting incident earlier on 21 September which took place on a private hire near Maitland cemetery. The exact circumstances are not yet clear," spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer told Eyewitness News. Also on Friday, two bystanders were injured in a shooting that took place at the Bellville taxi rank, where the SAPS also arrested four men on the scene. Traut confirmed that a case of attempted murder is being investigated following an incident which occurred at around 10.45am. "It is alleged that shots were exchanged between two groups of people and in the process two males, 28 years old and 33 years old, who were bystanders, were shot and wounded," he said. "Police members who were deployed to the area noticed a group of male persons standing in Voortrekker Road Bellville, and upon approaching the group, one male person produced a firearm. He was shot and wounded by police. "The group made an attempt to flee, but four of the five men were arrested in possession of an unlicensed firearm."
