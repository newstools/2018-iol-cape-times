The international wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC believes abalone is in danger of becoming extinct, with poachers having nabbed at least 96 million units of abalone in the country in the past 17 years. "Efforts to curb the illegal trade have roundly failed. Once abundant, the population of South African abalone Haliotis midae is declining to unprecedented levels," warned TRAFFIC in the report titled "Empty Shells: An assessment of abalone poaching and trade from southern Africa", News24 reported. "The rampant illegal harvesting of abalone has resulted in the loss of a valuable commodity worth approximately R628m per annum," said the report. Researchers believe the only way to protect the species from going extinct, and not lose the income legally fished abalone generates, is global collaboration to regulate its trade. This includes listing it again in terms of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).Â CITES protects the global trade in endangered, threatened and at-risk species. "That lack of regulation means that once abalone shipments have been smuggled out of South Africa to neighbouring countries, they can easily be laundered without fear of law enforcement action." According to the report, world imports of abalone outweigh legal production levels in southern Africa, with the total mass of imports from 2000 to 2016 being 55 863 tons, while only 18 905 tons was legally produced over the same period. Estimated traded volumes of illegally harvested abalone have steadily grown since 2008 and by 2016 the estimated mass of illegally harvested abalone reached 3 224 tons, contributing 64% of the total imports for that year.
