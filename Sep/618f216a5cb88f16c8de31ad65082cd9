The process of formalising the small-scale fisheries sector by amending the legislation has been concluded and the launch of the co-operatives is expected later this week. The co-operative was initiated following a need to formalise small-scale fisheries, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana said on Tuesday. Formalising the industry into co-operatives will benefit sustainable marine resources and facilitate developmental support programme to small-scale fishers, Zokwana said. The department said it had has invested resources in working with more than 300 communities in four coastal provinces. The community cooperatives will be given 15-year small-scale fishing rights. Separately, more than 270 communities had registered Expressions of Interest (EOIs) with the department, representing aboutÂ 20 000 fishers in South Africa. Registering an EOI is necessary to inform the department that the community contains small-scale fishers and that they would want to be part of the process of redrafting the Small-Scale Fishing Regulations.
