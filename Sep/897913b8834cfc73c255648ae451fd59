An innocent man from Hillview was killed moments after allegedly witnessing a gang shooting on Sunday afternoon. Residents say Gershen Cooper, 32, was on his way home on Sunday when he saw the gunmen and started running, but they turned their guns on him and fired about 15 shots. His heartbroken mother, Desiree, 60, says she was at home and heard the shots shortly after 5pm. “I was at home waiting for my colleague’s husband to drop something by me. He was by his friend’s house and I heard the shots and came out and still asked the one neighbour, are they mad to shoot like that? “I didn’t mean to go look but then all these people came running to me, saying he was shot. I asked them if he is still alive and they said he is dead and I became hysterical.” Police spokesperson Constable Grant Twigg confirmed the case and said that on arrival in Orchid Street, police found Gershen dead. He said the suspects fled the scene and police are investigating the shooting. Desiree said her son was unmarried and did not have any children. “He was working as a caretaker at Zerilda Primary School but when his contract came to an end, he worked odd jobs and did what he could to help people in the community, like help the women carry their packets and so on. “We can’t understand why they would shoot him. If he was a gangster then I could understand, but he wasn’t. I just leave it in God’s hands.” Anyone with information is asked to call Muizenberg police on 021 787 9000 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
