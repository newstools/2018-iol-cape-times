TimesLive reported than an innocent bystander was allegedly shot in the incident. A witness who arrived on the scene where a stolen BMW had crashed into a bakkie as it attempted to flee from police said the bystander was rushed to hospital. The BMW was being chased by police, who had radioed for backup, at the time. Police then set up a roadblock in Kromboom Road. "When the robber saw the police, he reversed into a white bakkie and the BMW turned over‚" the witness told TimesLiIve. He said that when he arrived‚ other bystanders said that the police had fired two shots at the fleeing suspect as he reversed into the bakkie, but that one of the bullets hit a man trying to get into his bakkie.
