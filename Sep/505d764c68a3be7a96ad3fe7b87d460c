Justice Zondo, chairperson of the commission, asked lawyers for parties implicated in evidence presented before him to attend tomorrow’s proceedings. Among those implicated by three of the six witnesses were former president Jacob Zuma, former communications minister Faith Muthambi, the Gupta family, former Government Communication and Information System director-general Mzwanele Manyi, and Hawks officials, advocate Mandla Mtolo and Major-General Zinhle Mnonopi. The witnesses who implicated the parties were former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas, former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor, and acting GCIS director-general Phumla Williams. The evidence of other witnesses, including the National Treasury’s acting chief procurement officer Willie Mathebula and international state capture authorities Professor Joel Welman and Dr Daniel Kaufmann, was largely expert evidence that did not implicate Zuma, the Guptas, or any of the current and former government officials. Williams will continue her evidence in which she revealed that Manyi sent her a text message while she was on the witness stand in a bid to influence her. The commission has threatened to summons Manyi. ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe this week dismissed Mentor’s testimony as lying under oath. Mentor told the commission the Guptas offered her the position of public enterprises minister to replace Barbara Hogan if she cancelled SAA’s India route, which they wanted. Mantashe said National Council of Provinces chairperson Thandi Modise was ANC deputy secretary-general at the time and not Jesse Duarte, who was only elected in December 2012. Zondo told Mentor and Maseko they may be recalled to testify should they be required, or if he granted lawyers for implicated parties permission to cross-examine witnesses. Sunday Independent
