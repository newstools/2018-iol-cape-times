A high-speed car chase in Green Point led to three people being arrested on Thursday for the alleged possession of a stolen vehicle. News24 reported that a 29-year-old woman and two men aged, 24 and 37, were nabbed in Cavalcade Road for the possession of a vehicle that had allegedly been hijacked in Table View, police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said. "During the pursuit, the vehicle collided with a wall in Cavalcade Road. One of the suspects attempted to flee and broke his leg," Traut said. Following the crash, officers from the Metro Police Department surrounded the vehicle to ensure that no one escaped, LPR Camera Project manager Jacques Weber said. "One of the suspects was trapped by the accident and had to be extracted from the vehicle by Cape Town Fire and Metro Rescue Services." The three suspects are expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Friday.
