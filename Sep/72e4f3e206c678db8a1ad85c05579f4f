A total of 94 book clubs will compete at this year’s reading competition hosted by the National Library of SA (NLSA), in collaboration with the Department of Correctional Services and the George Municipality. More than 900 spectators are expected to attend the event in George next week. Book clubs from across the country compete against each other in four categories: reading, debate, book reviews and spelling bee. The book clubs will compete in the 11 official languages, and this year visually impaired people will also participate. George Municipality’s senior manager of social services, Trevor Marillac, said: “We acknowledge the importance of intensifying the promotion of a culture of reading as it forms the basis for basic and further education. It is within this context that we have experienced a growth in interest in the establishment of book clubs. “The successful hosting of the Funda Mzantsi Reading Competition is truly a testament of what can be achieved through partnerships.” George Municipality hosted the competition in 2014 and became a full partner in 2015, forming an integral part of the logistics behind organising this massive event. NLSA executive officer and National Librarian Professor Rocky Ralebipi-Simela said: “We have witnessed the increase in book club registrations this year, which tells us that the competition is growing enormously. “Communities are responding positively and the love of reading among the youth is encouraging.” The contest will take place from October 1 to 5.
