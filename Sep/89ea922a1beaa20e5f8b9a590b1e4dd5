Cape Town - National Police commissioner Kehla Sithole is expected to brief Parliament’s portfolio committee on police on the review of the South African Police Service's security measures following a fatal shooting of a staff member last week. Parliament employee Lennox Garane shot himself at his workstation on the second floor of one of the office buildings within the legislature’s precinct. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman announced on Tuesday that permission had been obtained from the House Chairperson responsible for committees, Cedric Frolick, to convene a special meeting on Saps security measures at Parliament. “The National Commissioner of Police, General Kehla Sitole, and the relevant commanders responsible for national key points will be requested to brief the committee on progress regarding the recent shooting incident at Parliament and the review of Saps security measures at Parliament.  “The committee has also engaged the Portfolio Committee on Public Works and both chairpersons have agreed to hold a joint meeting. The Director-General of the Department of Public Works is expected to give a detailed outline of security infrastructure implemented in Parliament since 2015,” said Beukman.  He said it was important that both portfolio committees receive assurances that security measures at Parliament are at an adequate level. Saps and the State Security Agency (SSA) are probing the matter, while Parliament employees are receiving counseling and support following the incident. Political Bureau
