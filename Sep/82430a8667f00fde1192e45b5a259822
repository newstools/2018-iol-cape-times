Cape Town - The newly appointed DA premier candidate, “premier of jobs” as dubbed by DA leader Mmusi Maimane, Alan Winde says he is looking to focus on job creation and access to housing in the province. Winde who currently serves as MEC for economic opportunities was nominated as the DA premier candidate to succeed Helen Zille who will complete her second term next year. He said his term in office will ensure that health, education and housing are prioritised. “I will continue focusing on jobs, health and education which is the primary constitutional mandate of the province, education and health is where much of the budget goes. My own focus will also be on safety and security, public transport and resilience,” said Winde. Winde was competing against provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela and DA MP David Maynier for the post. Madikizela took himself out of the running for mayor to contest for the premiership job. Madikizela threw his weight behind Winde, whom he said he was confident he will serve the province well. The ANC in the Western Cape has however slammed Winde’s election, saying that the move by the party to appoint him showed that Zille was still in control. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs said: “It is clear that Helen Zille is still the real power in the DA. She has ensured that her preferred candidate Alan Winde has emerged victorious. “Winde, like Zille, has demonstrated that his main task has been the preservation of economic power in the hands of a  privileged elite who have always controlled the provincial economy,“ said Jacobs.
