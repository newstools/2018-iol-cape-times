 The average water consumption for the past week declined from 535 million litres per day to 526 million litres per day.  Earlier today, the City of Cape Town announced that it would lower water restrictions and tariffs from Level 6 to Level 5 from 1 October 2018 due to the encouraging dam recovery and the ongoing conservation efforts by Capetonians.  In a statement on Monday, the deputy mayor of the city, Alderman Ian Neilson, said: "Water restrictions and the associated tariffs are thus to be conservatively lowered in the interim to Level 5 from 1 October 2018".   He said the water usage target will be increased from 50 to 70 litres per person per day.  The reduction is based on usage hovering around the 500 million litre-mark. The City encourages its water users to stay the course and continue to conserve water to ensure that Cape Town remains in this usage band.  @TheCapeArgus   argusnews@inl.co.za   Cape Argus
