A Goodwood Rugby Club first team player has been declared brain dead after being injured in a tackle at the weekend. The chairman of the club, Johann Vorster, denied reports that the 31-year-old Kyle Barnes had died, Die Burger reported. Father-of-two Barnes, from Ravensmead, has been a patient at the Vergelegen Mediclinic in Somerset West since Saturday. “I don’t want to say too much about the situation until the family has made a decision,” said Vorster. The incident occurred in the second half of an away league fixture against Strand United. According to Vorster, Barnes had bent down to pick up the ball when he was tackled. “It appears that another player collided with Barnes’s neck. He went to ground and was later brought to hospital while still conscious,” said Vorster. Barnes, who played wing, had to have an emergency operation to reduce swelling on the brain. “I understand that a piece of his skull had to be removed to reduce the swelling on the brain. But he was declared brain dead at 10am yesterday.” The much-loved Barnes has been coupled to a life support system.
