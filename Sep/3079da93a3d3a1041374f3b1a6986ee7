NSRI Table Bay skipper said they were alerted by the Transnet National Ports Authority that an unauthorised man on board the UAL Lobito had fallen just after the ship left the port on Monday. Two NSRI rescue swimmers and the two paramedics found the injured man in a barely accessible area of the ship, among containers. “A technical rescue operation commenced. The man, aged 22, suffered a suspected fractured ankle sustained from a fall. "(He) was extricated by the rescue crew using a stokes basket stretcher and high-angle ropes and equipment, and he was medically cared for by the EMS rescue paramedics. “The second male, aged 18, was in the care of ship’s crew and was not injured,” the NSRI said. The NSRI said the men were taken back to the port, and the injured patient was taken to hospital in a stable condition. Police are investigating.
