Perfect spring weather greeted all at the Winterton Rugby Club, with players and supporters alike buoyed by the Springboks’ exhilarating win against the All Blacks at the weekend. Sarla chief executive Stefan Terblanche said: “Sarla thanks all of our Legends and is grateful for their time and energy, plus their commitment to giving back by passing on their valuable knowledge to the next generation of rugby talent. "All of this made for another successful event, raising some much-needed funds for the Drakensberg Rugby Club.” Before the match kicked off at 3pm, young players from the nearby region were treated to a rugby clinic, with skills and advice shared by legendary coach Ian McIntosh. This year’s edition of the Battle of the Legends featured a majority of KwaZulu-Natal-based Sarla legends and players from the Drakensberg Rugby Club, with the SA Legends once again remaining undefeated. Drakensberg-based farmer and one of South Africa’s all-time great flyhalves, Henry “Lem” Honiball, joined the team in the changeroom to do the traditional pre-match jersey handout before they took to the field. Right from the start, the Legends dominated play, controlling the field with some impressive play in the first 20 minutes. The strong forward pack of the Legends kept the Drakensberg team at bay, and they continuously camped out in their opposition’s half. They were rewarded with a half-time score of 29-5. The second half echoed the first, with some remarkable moves leading the team to a 48-12 victory. Terblanche said: “All of our Legends who participated in the Drakensberg game gave their all, ensuring an exhilarating afternoon. Once again we spent valuable time together and I was told that the Rugby Clinic was a rewarding and worthwhile activity.” The very first Legends game in Winterton took place more than 15 years ago in 2002, bringing together former players for a dynamic afternoon of fun and friendship.
