The elections were supposed to start yesterday but the institution delayed screening of candidates for about a week and a half, said SRC president Phathindwe Mncamase. Mncamase said ballots were not ready and that manifestos were not concluded. However, he said the screening of candidates had been conducted. Voting at the Athlone, Mowbray and Wellington campuses will now take place today and tomorrow, while the process begins at the Cape Town and Bellville campuses on Monday and Tuesday.
