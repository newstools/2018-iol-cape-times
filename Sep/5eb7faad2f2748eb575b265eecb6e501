A 21-year-old farmworker, Johannes Bangiso, has been sentenced in the Western Cape High Court sitting in Mossel Bay to 22 years in jail for the murder of a widow on a farm near Albertinia. He was also sentenced to one year for housebreaking and another seven years for robbery with aggravating circumstances, the SABC reported on Friday. The sentences will run concurrently. The 52-year-old Sharon Bester lived on the farm Zout van de Aarde in the district of Albertinia. Her body was discovered in October last year by one of her workers. She had been strangled and had a blunt-force trauma injury to the head. Bangiso, who grew up on the farm, had used Bester's stolen car to fetch his girlfriend in Riversdale. Meanwhile, police are investigating a case of murder after the body of a 95-year-old woman was found in the townhouse where she lived in Eastcliff, Hermanus. A security guard found her body around 5pm on Wednesday, police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana told Netwerk24.
