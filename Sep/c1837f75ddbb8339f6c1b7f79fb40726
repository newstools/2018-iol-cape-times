More than a month after a 13-year-old Athlone girl was raped, police have yet to gather evidence from the crime scene, the Daily Voice reported. Suspect Wazier “Koppe” Jumah, 39, made a third appearance at the Wynberg Magistrate's Court for his bail hearing, where it was revealed he had previously been convicted for raping a 15-year-old girl, also in Athlone. Jumah was arrested on July 26 after he allegedly snatched the girl, who was on her way home after visiting a friend. He allegedly held her hostage in his aunt’s council flat for several hours, where he drugged and repeatedly raped her. Emotions ran high at court when the investigating officer, Sergeant Salome Ngotya, struggled to answer questions by defence lawyer Kyle Jason and the State prosecutor. Ngotya said medical examinations confirmed the girl had been raped and assaulted. But she claimed due to a lack of vehicles, she had not been able to visit the crime scene. In addition, the blade used to shave the girl’s private parts, the cool drink containing the alleged drugs, and the girl’s ripped jeans have not yet been recovered. “I cannot go if I am not on standby because I don’t have a vehicle. The accused had the keys (to the house) and I could not just get into the crime scene without him being there,” she said, before admitting that she never requested the keys from him and had also not taken a statement from the girl’s friend. “Sy doen nie haar werk nie (she is not doing her job),” a woman was heard shouting from the gallery. In his affidavit, Jumah claims the girl was in his home with another person drinking, but she left and the next day he was accused of rape. The hearing was postponed to September 12 as the State plans to introduce new evidence.
