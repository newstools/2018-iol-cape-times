The R40 000 facility, the fourth in the province, is a specialised counselling room that will play a critical role in enabling specialist social workers to assist children who have been physically, emotionally or sexually abused. Provincial Department of Social Development spokesperson Sihle Ngobese said the facility was a safe place for children to report serious crimes. “Play therapy is an innovative counselling technique used by social workers to communicate with and help children, to prevent or resolve psychosocial challenges.” The department encourages members of the public seeking assistance from social workers to visit the facility and its local offices or contact the department via its hotline, 0800 220 250.
