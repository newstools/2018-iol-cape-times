The State isn't going to enter into a plea agreement with the Spanish dentist who allegedly killed his 3-year-old twins in his Hout Bay holiday flat. Mario-Cesar Deus Yela appeared in the Western Cape High Court before Judge Vincent Saldanha on Monday, Netwerk24 reported. His trial has been postponed twice last month to allow Yela and the State to reach a plea agreement. His former wife and mother of the murdered twins, Julia Engelhorn, didn't take her eyes off him during the court proceedings. She happened on the gruesome discovery of their dead twins, Octavia and Maximo, in his holiday flat in Hout Bay. Aside from the murder charges, he is also accused of stealing Engelhorn's car and threatening her with a knife. Yela had invited his ex-wife for lunch so that she could fetch the twins. Their other son was at school at the time. When she arrived at the flat, she found the twins' bodies, when Yela allegedly threatened her with a knife. In the time she ran to fetch the security guards at the complex, he allegedly fled in her car. Police apprehended him in Wynberg. The case continues on November 12.
