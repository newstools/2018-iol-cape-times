No arrests have been made after a woman, who is in a critical condition, was shot in the stomach in Bonteheuwel after being caught in alleged gang rivalry over drug sales. "It is completely out of control. The community is reeling at the moment," said local DA councillor Angus McKenzie, who told News24 that Wednesday's shooting was the third since Sunday. McKenzie said that on Tuesday he counted 40 shots fired in quick succession in the area. On Sunday night, three people were shot in a drive-by shooting. One person was killed, one was shot in the stomach and one in the leg. On Tuesday morning, the 40 shots rang out but no fatalities were reported. In the evening, more shots were heard and one person was found to have been shot in the stomach, and two people in the leg. McKenzie said the shooting took place near a primary school where children, staff and parents congregate for drop-offs and pick-ups. A reading centre for young children has already been closed because of safety concerns. "The shooting is happening in broad daylight," he said. "It is purely gang-related shootings. It boils down to a war of drug turf. It is one gang versus the next gang to be able to sell drugs." According to McKenzie, Bonteheuwel only has a satellite police station where a constable confirms affidavits. Provincial Community Safety MEC Dan Plato said that he was told the victim was in her early twenties and had been transferred from a local clinic to a hospital. He said he understood that the violence, between the Hard Livings and Playboys gangs, was only in a "pocket" of Bonteheuwel and that the gang members disappeared whenever they spotted police.
