In its third year, the museum hosted an Open Day on Heritage Day and welcomed 1528 local visitors. According to the museum, this was 9% more than the 1 400 visitors received in 2017. Some visitors were unable to participate in the tour due to an increased demand. “The museum is committed to ensuring that those visitors who won tickets in our Open Day competition and met the entry requirements will experience the tour in the future. "We wish to assure the public that management is reviewing internal procedures to increase capacity to handle a high demand and to streamline the ticket and boarding process,” the museum said. Spokesperson Morongoa Ramaboa said: “We wish to apologise to our community for the manner in which the crowds were managed this Heritage weekend, we appreciate the enthusiasm South Africans have displayed in experiencing our tour.” The Open Day was one of the many initiatives aimed at making it easier and accessible for South Africans to visit and learn more about the Island’s heritage and to experience the natural beauty of the world heritage site. “Many of the visitors were excited to be able to experience the tour and the Islands’ history on Heritage Day. When visitors arrived they were welcomed by tour guides, some of whom are ex-political prisoners who were incarcerated in Robben Island’s maximum security prison, along with many other South African struggle heroes. "Tour guides narrated the Island history, including their time in the prison and the struggle for freedom and equality,” the museum said. Ramaboa said as part of the public heritage education efforts, the museum believed that by encouraging wider community participation in Robben Island it had a chance to share and preserve a rich cultural heritage with all South Africans. To continue its Heritage celebration the museum is offering a 20% discount for the rest of this week as part of South African Tourism’s Sho’t Left Travel Week Campaign.
