Raging fires killed four people at the weekend, including a 15-year-old girl from Phumlani Village, Pelican Park. The Pelican Park fire broke out yesterday and gutted 10 shacks, leaving 40 people destitute.In Ncesde Street, Philippi East, on Saturday, a residential fire killed three people – two women aged 25 and 55 and a man also aged 55. The City's fire and rescue services spokesperson, Theo Layne, said they died as a result of smoke inhalation. Phumlani Village residents claimed they tried in vain to save 15-year-old Akhona Fufu, but they were no match for the raging flames. Community leader Sidwell Kweba said: “People are still not sure how the fire started, but it started around 3am and apparently it spread fast, trapping Akhona and her boyfriend, who managed to escape but was seriously injured. "Screams were heard of her calling for help. Neighbours and other residents did everything in their power to save her but the flames were too high and no one could enter the house. "If maybe we also had easy access to water, maybe the number of shacks burnt would have been less.”Kweba said the residents were tired of living in shacks and demanded proper houses. "The area needed to be reblocked as ambulances and other emergency vehicles struggled to access the area and assist with the fire, he added. In July last year, residents took to the streets, highlighting that they have been waiting for houses for three decades. They also complained about a lack of adequate sewerage. Of the three killed in Philippi East, police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest docket had been opened, while Layne said the cause of both fires had not been established.
