#1MillionMaths campaign’s initiators, Cape Town-based Siyavula Education company, invites all South Africans to submit a million maths sums during October. This week the company announced that corporate giant Standard Bank, the Sasol Foundation and UK-based initiative Fair Hope jointly pledged R1m if South Africans hit the target of completing the million sums on Siyavula’s online learning platform. Siyavula challenged not just high school learners, their teachers and parents but all corporates and the public to get involved in the campaign. With exams around the corner and high school pupils gearing up for one more mega-push, Siyavula is helping take the sting out of their studying by giving them free access to its site for the month of October, and lining up daily prizes, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops. All they have to do is sign up on siyavula.com during October and start practising for exams by submitting sums exercises, according to Siyavula Education chief executive Mark Horner. “We’re confident that we’ll not just meet, but exceed our target of one million exercises in just one month. We’d like any organisation or individual who wants to up the ante to get in touch. “Anything from an endorsement to media coverage to help us spread the word, to an extension of the R1-per-sum fund-raise,” he added. Siyavula would reward the school whose pupils and teachers contributed the most exercises towards the goal of reaching the 1 million maths exercises mark, said Horner.
