A former police sergeant has been sentenced to six years in jail in the Bellville Commercial Crimes Court on corruption charges. The 41-year-old Jeremy Slingers was stationed at the Malmesbury police station and accepted several bribes in 2014. The court found Slingers guilty of contravening the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act and corrupt activities relating to public officers, the SABC reported. He also faced charges of fraud. The National Prosecuting Authority said a mitigating factor was that Slingers displayed some remorse when making admissions towards the end of the trial. On Sunday, officers arrested a 27-year-old female in Maitland for possession of dagga. Officers also impounded a vehicle and trailer for dumping in Station Rd, Montague Gardens. The following fines and notice was also issued in the area: Dumping – R5 000; disobeying an instruction from an officer – R1 500; polluting the environment – no admission of guilt.
