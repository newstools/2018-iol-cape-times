The area of the national road leading in and out of Beaufort West, dubbed the "road of death", has become synonymous with crashes that regularly claim lives and injure many. In the most recent incident, a 3-year-old boy and a baby girl were killed in a minibus taxi crash between Beaufort West and Prince Albert early on Wednesday morning, while a woman lost a leg. Provincial Traffic Chief Kenny Africa said the crash occurred 73km outside Beaufort West and more towards Prince Albert Road, when the driver lost control of the taxi, causing it to roll. “It is difficult to say at this stage how many people who in the taxi were injured because some of the people got into a passing taxi. The driver fled the scene. “All we know at this stage is that the driver lost control of the vehicle and either fell asleep behind the wheel or was driving too fast. It’s difficult to speculate,” said Africa. No other vehicle had been involved and the police are busy with investigations, and charges of culpable homicide will be brought against the driver of the taxi, he added. Last Thursday, 10 people died as a result of a bus crash in which 30 others were injured on Aberdeen Road, 50km outside Beaufort West. Initial reports had indicated that the driver lost control of the bus after striking an animal that had appeared in the road, according to Transport and Public Works MEC Donald Grant. “This crash occurred on a stretch of road that has had a long history of public transport crashes, claiming lives and injuring many. “These incidents have, however, decreased substantially in recent times since the introduction of various road safety interventions on that strip of road, which include an Average Speed Over Distance camera enforcement system, and our successful fatigue management law enforcement operations,” said Grant.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
