Department spokesperson Byron la Hoe said about 120 000 vehicles travel along this stretch of road during peak periods. “The addition of a third lane in both directions will significantly reduce traffic congestion on one of Cape Town’s busiest roads," he said. “The project is expected to be complete by May 2019. "Work on installing the Freeway Management System, fibre optic bank, and Wemmershoek pipeline is complete, as is work on the concrete retaining walls, Old Oak inbound on-ramp temporary bypass, and the Phase 1 widening of the third lanes in the median. The Old Oak inbound on-ramp is also complete, and open to traffic.” Daily closures He said new lanes had been marked between Old Oak off-ramp and the R300 road to reduce congestion while construction is under way. “Daily closures are required on the main carriage ways for removing existing surfacing and laying new ultra-thin friction course surfacing," hev warned. "The reconstruction of the western portion of Old Oak Road Bridge will cause some discomfort to road users until its completion, which is expected towards the end of 2018. In the meantime, the Old Oak Road East bridge is carrying all northbound and southbound traffic,” he said. Current work in progress includes, among others, the pavement rehabilitation on the N1 carriageways, which will be completed in October 2018, and the widening of the Jip de Jager Interchange and ramp, as well as the Old Oak Interchange and ramp.
