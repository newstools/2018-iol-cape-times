Tommie Lehmkühl, the chairperson of the Blind SA employment committee, said: “We applaud Lixil Africa and other good corporate citizens for giving blind and visually impaired persons an opportunity to be employed, and for them to become taxpayers and contribute to our economy.” It all began in March 2016 when Blind SA was contacted by an official in the human resources section of Lixil Africa (Cobra Waters) in Krugersdorp for advice on how to deal with the matter of one of their employees whose sight was deteriorating. Cobra Waters management and union officials were exposed to awareness-raising disability sensitisation and basic environmental changes to meet the reasonable accommodation needs of the employee. The immediate supervisor and colleagues were also shown basic sighted guide skills so that they could correctly and appropriately help the employee.
