The department’s spokesperson, Alaric Jacobs, said it had seen about 44 patients this year. Spinal injuries affect the patients mentally, physically, socially, sexually and vocationally. The latest incident involved the killing of a 22-year-old woman who was shot in Mongoose Street, Tafelsig. A 34-year-old man was wounded during the same incident. Police spokesperson Wesley Twigg said the public had been asked for its assistance as no one had been arrested. Cape Flats communities have been outraged by the ongoing gang violence and shootings that have seen innocent residents, including children, being killed by stray bullets. Last week, residents of Bonteheuwel and Kensington took to the streets in protest, claiming violence had reached unprecedented levels. On Wednesday, the Manenberg Safety Forum, the United Public Safety Front, Bishop Lavis and Elsies River will also be marching against gang violence. The Manenberg Crisis Forum chairperson, Roegshanda Pascoe, said: “The march is very important because people are suffering over the loss of loved ones through gang warfare, smash-and-grabs and break-ins. “These all come down to organised crime and are not isolated incidents. It is time to stand together as communities instead of against each other, as we all want peace. “Good news is rare in our communities, you just hear about rape, kidnapping and murder,” she said. ‘‘The silence from our leaders and councillors is killing us. That is a crime on its own as our human rights are being grossly violated.” Anyone with any information about the Tafelsig shooting can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
