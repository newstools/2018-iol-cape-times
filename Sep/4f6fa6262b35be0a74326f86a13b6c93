Four people were shot and wounded in Valhalla Park on Friday, police say. The shooting occurred at around 11am in Hector Street, a small road near a skate park and a primary school, News24 reported. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the victims were aged 22, 23, 25 and 32. The shootings come after repeated community meetings and marches in Valhalla Park and the neighbouring suburb Bishop Lavis to bring a stop to the ongoing shootings, which some people believe are related to gang rivalry. Police are investigating a case of attempted murder. Another march is planned for October 3. Meanwhile, in the early hours of Friday morning, the Metro Police Department executed numerous search warrants in Macassar. Officers arrested 19 suspects between the ages 18 and 50.
