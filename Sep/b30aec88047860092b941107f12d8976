A young father from Pinelands broke his pelvis after he allegedly fell from a moving train during a robbery. Relatives say the incident happened on Thursday morning as the man fought off a robber on the Northern Line. Lendl Pardenwachter, 27, was heading to his construction job when he was attacked by robbers just before 8am at Akasia Park station. A family member, who asked not to be named, says he had just dropped Lendl at the Cape Town station. “He called me while he was lying on the train tracks. He was crying and said he was in excruciating pain,” says the relative. “There were no security on board the train and after refusing to give up his minimum valuables - his cellphone and some loose change - he scuffled with the perpetrators, which resulted in him falling from the moving train.” He says Lendl was then rushed to Tygerberg Hospital. “I accompanied him in the ambulance to hospital. He sustained a broken pelvis, broken left leg and multiple internal injuries in the process. “The doctor’s prognosis was not final due to the severity of the swelling. “He will never have the same use of his body physically again. The doctor says it could take about a year for Lendl to recover and heal from these injuries. “His pelvis was completely shattered and had to be reconstructed. We will be taking steps against Metrorail. Since the incident, no one from Metrorail even contacted the family.” However, Metrorail spokesperson Zino Mihi says, according to their reports, Lendl was trying to board a moving train when he fell. “The information we received is that a male in his late twenties fell on the tracks at Akasia Park station as he was trying to board a moving train,” Mihi says. “He is alleged to have sustained a broken left hip. It was confirmed to us that there was security at the station. “An ambulance was dispatched to the station and the man was rushed to Tygerberg Hospital. The investigation is under way.” Daily Voice
