Now that Liam Luke January and his family have raised the funds, they are continuing their drive to help ­others. Liam is a Grade 1 pupil at Vista Nova cerebral palsy school in Rondebosch. Brittle bones disease is a rare disorder that affects the make-up of the body’s connective tissue, resulting in extremely brittle bones. His therapist had recommended the wheelchair to get Liam from class to class. With a cost of R42 136, the family could not afford to buy one and that was when they began their relentless efforts. “We did social media, approached the Faith Hope and Love organisation, as well as the Sweethearts Foundation to put him on waiting list,” said his mom, Edwina January. The Sweethearts Foundation collect bread tags and bottle caps that are recycled by local companies who give the organisation a standard adult wheelchair or funds to purchase one in return: 450kg tops = 1 standard adult wheelchair, and 50kg tags = 1 standard adult wheelchair. The family are continuing their drive for others on the waiting list of the Sweetheart Foundation. They have also set up a trust for Liam that will help him throughout his life, with therapy costs and future wheelchair costs. Plastic bottle caps and bread clips for Liam’s cause can be dropped off at Vista Nova in Rondebosch or Sunnyside Primary, Grassdale High school, Islamia Primary, Spitfire Kromboom, Kannemeyer Primary and Rio Grande Manenberg.
