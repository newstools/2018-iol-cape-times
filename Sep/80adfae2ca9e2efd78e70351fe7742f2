Until the Constitutional Court finalises a precedent-setting judgment that orders the State, within 24 months, to recognise Muslim marriages under common law, marriages in terms of Sharia (Islamic law) can only be dissolved in accordance with the Divorce Act 70 of 1979. In the case of a husband who is a spouse in more than one Muslim marriage, courts must take into consideration all relevant factors including any contract or agreement, and must make an equitable order. Western Cape High Court Judge Siraj Desai on Friday found the president and cabinet had failed at their constitutional obligations by not recognising the marriages under law. This after the Women’s Legal Centre argued that by not recognising Muslim marriages under common law, Muslim women were not afforded legal protection and did not have access to the courts to assert their rights. Judge Desai said that if the case went to the Constitutional Court, the deadline of 24 months would be suspended. In the meantime, until Muslim marriages are legally recognised, the court has declared that a union, validly concluded as a marriage in terms of Sharia, should be dissolved in accordance with the Divorce Act 70 of 1979, and all the provisions of the act shall now be applicable. “If administrative or practical problems arise in the implementation of this order, an interested person may approach this court for a variation of this order,” Judge Desai said. The Department of Home Affairs has asked for time to study the judgment, yesterday saying: “We note the judgment. ‘‘We are in the process of studying the order and will make further comments in due course. We also note that the decision is subject to confirmation by the Constitutional Court.”
