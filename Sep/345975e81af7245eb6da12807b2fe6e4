"One of the suspect's, number 74 on the non-taxi and non-proxy list, was arrested at his house in Goodwood with 46 outstanding warrants to the monetary value of R37 450.

On Thursday afternoon, officers held a warrant roadblock in Klipfontein Road in Heideveld, opposite the Manenberg police station, the City added. At around 6.20pm, a Toyota Avanza was pulled over and the driver checked for outstanding warrants. He had a double warrant outstanding and was led to the lock-up by an officer, but managed to escape and the officer gave chase. The officer, assisted by colleagues, chased the suspect through the Heideveld residential area. When the suspect was eventually caught after a long chase, an officer noticed he was trying to get rid of something. The suspect was found in possession of a firearm Taurus .38 special loaded with five rounds. After making the firearm safe, the officer noticed that the serial number was filed off. The suspect admitted not having a permit to possess the firearm. The suspect was taken to Manenberg police station, where a case was registered for further investigation for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.
