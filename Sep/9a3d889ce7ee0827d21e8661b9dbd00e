To raise support and awareness, the SABMR wanted to see what it would take for an ordinary person to get 100 000 strangers to even just like a Facebook status. “The purpose of the campaign is to bring home the difficulty of finding a match... illustrated by seeing how long it takes to reach 100 000 people to like, tag and share on our microsite,” said SABMR deputy director Terry Schlaphoff. “The more people become involved, the more likely we can increase the chances of finding a match to save a life,” she added. In South Africa, at least 500 000 donors are needed. “Registering new donors requires reaching out to communities, careful screening for eligibility and, of course, funding for the all-important testing,” Schlaphoff said.
