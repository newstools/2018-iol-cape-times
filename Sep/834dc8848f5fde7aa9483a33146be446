Reuters reported that 44 people died and 660 were injured during a powerful earthquake in northern Japan. The team consisted of Stellenbosch High School Grade 12 pupil Tian Cilliers, Curro Durbanville pupil Ralph McDougall, Parklands College pupil Emile Tredoux and the only Grade 11 pupil, Taariq Mowzer of Fairbairn College. These four were the winners of last year’s Standard Bank Computer Olympiad. The IOI gives participants the opportunity to mix with other participants and experience different cultures. About 335 high school pupils from 87 countries participated at the IOI international coding contest last week. The team is determined to do better next year after a disappointing competition. “The competition was very stressful and challenging,” said Mowzer. “I believe I could’ve have done better, especially when it came to time management. “But this was a learning curve and I know what to work on now, so I’m confident I will do better next time. “Some (people) got a fright from the earthquake but we were taught what to do (and) we didn’t panic.(Aside from) the two earthquakes and typhoon, we had a great experience as we saw the princess.” McDougall said: “We were amazed at the opening ceremony when the holographic depiction of the IOI mascot came to life and welcomed us.” Five countries from Africa entered 19 participants altogether. Mowzer, McDougall and Cilliers came third, fourth and sixth, respectively, among the 19 contestants from Africa.
