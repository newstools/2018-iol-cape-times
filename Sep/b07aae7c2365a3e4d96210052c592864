The Western Cape Forensic Pathology Services have retrieved the remains of all the victims who died in Monday's explosion at the Rheinmetall Denel Munition's plant in Macassar, near Somerset West. There is still no confirmation from Rheinmetall Denel Munition on the number of people who died. The Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service reported that eight people had died. Forensic pathologist Professor Johann Dempers told the SABC the process to identify the victims is expected to be completed next week. The heat in the building was reportedly 2000Â°C. "The remains are in the forensic mortuary as mandated by law, We are examining the remains. Currently, my team is collecting specimens for DNA matching. "The identity is really important and to be able to tell the family, if we find remains, whether that is actually part of their family member." Ward councillor Victor Isaacs told Macassar residents on Tuesday evening DNA testing was required to identify the casualties, News24 reported. The building had housed a blending operation for five different propellants used in artillery charges. According to Isaacs, the explosion occurred while the workers were busy with the blending. Ward councillor Victor Isaacs told the residents the representatives had withdrawn from attending as "they say they are worried about their safety".
