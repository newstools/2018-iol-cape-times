Macassar - Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has extended his condolences to the families of eight Denel workers who died in an explosion earlier this week. Gordhan visited the site in Macassar just outside Cape Town on Friday afternoon. “At this point in time, it’s a very sensitive moment for the families because there are all these forensic processes that need to be concluded before any definitive answers can be given to questions we all have,” Gordhan said. Eight people were killed when propellant in the Rheinmetall Denel Munition depot in Macassar ignited on Monday. Details around the incident remain sketchy, but Gordhan said the investigation team will be drawn from the police, department of labour and will also include an independent investigator. “The investigation is done by various agencies so we might have an independent view of what might have been the cause of the explosion.” Gordhan said a memorial service is planned for the families once they give the go-ahead.
