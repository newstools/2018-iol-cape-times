Petrolheads across Cape Town are revving up for one of the most anticipated events on the motoring calendar, which returns for its third year on Heritage Day. All the tyre-slaying mayhem that patrons have become accustomed to will be going down on the Grand Parade, where Drift City promises to bring all the action on Monday. Drift City spokesperson Jason Clark said spectators can look forward to 32 drifting competitors engulfing the iconic landmark with tyre smoke as they vie for the top spot. “This year we are looking at a full field of at least 32 competitors, with purpose-built, high-powered machines. These guys will be attacking the Drift Course and chasing the clock to be crowned King Of Drift City 2018. “This year we are excited to announce that Danny Cross, a driver from the UK, will actually be competing against SA's best drifters on Cape Town soil. "The day is also jam-packed with other activities for patrons, like a go-kart track, spectator rides with SR4A and stunt-bike demonstrations. There is also a Kids Zone for the little ones, tons of good food and a beer garden,” Clark said. Drift City prides itself on the fact that it is the only event that has formulated its own, very unique set of rules based on a combination of drifting and gymkhana. Emphasis is put on speed, smoke and all-out entertainment value. Hosting the event on Heritage Day, Clark said they strive to bring something authentic to the people of Cape Town. “All we ever wanted to do is host an event in Cape Town, for Cape Town and by Cape Town. That’s all. Something that feels international but shows off local talent. “Drift City is about who we are as Gearheads and about how we can all enjoy something positive and exciting across all social differences, with the blessing of the City. It’s not about ‘who is doing it’ for us, it’s about doing it for all of us'.” Gates open at 11am and tickets are available at Computicket.
