A Cape Town events company is taking the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association (KKKA) to court over alleged non-payment for services rendered for this year's Tweede Nuwejaar parade. The co-director of Bharooch events management, Sharief Baker, told the SABC he was never paid for organising the carnival for the 2017/2018 financial year. He claims he is owed about R300 000. This while the City last week announced an allocation of more than R4 million in support for the minstrels. Without having a proper agreement in place with them, Baker said, the KKKA brought in another partner. "What I feared would happen happened, when we started to be sidelined in favour of another company to take over the management of the event. Right towards the end, we committed ourselves, but then a lot of threats were made and a lot of allegations were made. "Right up until two/three days before the Tweede Nuwejaar main event, we requested our contracts, we requested our payment, we sent invoices, but to no avail." KKKA director Muneeb Gambino said they would be happy to respond in court to allegations what they allegedly owe Bharooch. Gambino said Baker and his company withdrew from the contract before he could deliver. "Mr Sharief Baker refused to enter into a written contract with us; he then provided part service on the 16 December last year. We paid him for the part service. He was supposed to deliver full service for the 2 January. "He repudiated his contract. We said that we would not accept his repudiation and then we insisted that he deliver a full service. "He refused to deliver a full service, withdrew from the supposed verbal contract, and now he turns around and says we owe him money." A court date has not been finalised yet.
