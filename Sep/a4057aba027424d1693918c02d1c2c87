Former ANC Western Cape leader Marius Fransman has not yet heeded an SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) directive to apologise to the SA Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) for public comments he made. This was for "offensive and inflammatory" public statements he made in 2013. Two weeks ago, he was directed to apologise to the SAJBD via a written acknowledgement. He was given a month to apologise. Fransman confirmed to News24 on Friday that he has not yet responded to the SAHRC's recommendation, but plans to respond within the next two weeks, just before the deadline. On a Cape Town Muslim radio station, he accused the SAJBD of undermining the transformation of the CBD and the Cape Flats and that they lacked loyalty to South Africa. The commission found his comments violated the dignity of the Jewish community. Fransman was the deputy minister of international relations at the time he made the remarks. According to SAJBD spokesperson Wendy Kahn, they had tried on several occasions to engage with Fransman before approaching the commission. After the ruling, Kahn said: “We are very encouraged by the ruling, we feel very strongly that people in high, political office have an added responsibility in terms of our constitution to treat fellow South Africans with dignity. We believe this is a very good ruling." The Human Rights Commission described Fransman's comments as 'insensitive, disrespectful and not designed to bring about the unity that he professed to be important to advance". Fransman was, however, found not guilty of inciting hate speech.
