Cape Town - A suspect was arrested in Kalk Bay after he was found in possession of suspected drugs, as well as seven bank cards belonging to different people, six driver's licences, an identity document which did not belong to him and R19 710 cash. According to Wayne Dyason, Law Enforcement Inspector at the City of Cape Town, the suspect was arrested on Wednesday night by the City's Law Enforcement Auxiliary officers who were on foot patrol and specifically keeping an eye out for drug dealers. “The officers were on foot patrol and specifically keeping an eye out for drug dealers when they spotted a well-known car guard in the vicinity of Kalk Bay station leaning into a vehicle and chatting to the driver,” said Dyason. “They observed an exchange of items take place between the driver and car guard and immediately pounced on the suspect. The car guard was found in possession of eight packets of a substance which appeared to be cocaine.” The suspect refused to cooperate with the officers and resisted arrest. He also called on his friends in the area to his aid but the officers overpowered him and called for back up. “After a tense stand-off, the back up arrived and the suspect was found to be in possession of R19 710 in cash, seven bank cards belonging to different people, six driver's licences and one ID document which was not his. He was arrested and taken to Muizenberg SAPS." African News Agency/ANA
