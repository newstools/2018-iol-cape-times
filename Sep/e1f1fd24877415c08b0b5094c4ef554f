The production will take place at several community centres during the upcoming school holidays and be performed at primary schools across the province thereafter. Since most people do not have house phones any more, the City’s 107 help number has become obsolete. The new number is 021 480 7700. Artistic director Theo Davids said: “The three digits do not go through on cellphones, and these days, most kids use mobile phones. “So, it’s a 10 digit number, but it will still be a free call.” The pantomime features classic child favourites like Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Cinderella and The Three Little Pigs, re-created in a real-life setting of what to do if danger confronts them. “We teach them the number before the show, so whenever there’s danger in the show, we show the number on big flashcards. “In the story of Little Red Riding Hood, for example, if the wolf wants to eat grandma, the actors will shout who must we call. Big flashcards appear in front of the show.” The show is interactive and uses fairy tales as a metaphor for real-life danger situations. Davids said they addressed situations like fire, kidnapping and robbery, among others. Learners are also allowed to comment during the show, which it will be performed in either English, Afrikaans, Xhosa or a combination of the languages. At the conclusion of the show, they will conduct a We got talent show, where learners will display their artistic talents in a two-minute showcase of dance, drama and music and win a sponsored prize. “We are very excited. This is much needed. With the things happening around us, it is important to know our emergency numbers,” Davids added.
