Following the latest crime statistics showing an increase in contact crimes across the country, an HIV/Aids NGO, Right to Care, has called on all who have been raped or sexually assaulted to report the crime to the police and to access health-care services as soon as possible. Right to Care is a non-profit organisation that supports and delivers prevention, care and treatment services for HIV and TB. Right to Care spokesperson Palesa Khambi said if someone has been raped or sexually assaulted, they should keep the evidence and take it to a police station. After reporting the rape, the victim should go to the nearest clinic or health facility, where staff will assist with HIV and STI testing and treatment, including post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP includes taking antiretroviral medicines after being potentially exposed to HIV, to prevent becoming infected, and is available at hospitals, clinics or Thuthuzela Care Centres. “The Thuthuzela Care Centres located in provinces throughout South Africa have become a vital part of dealing with the aftermath of rape and sexual assault in South Africa. "Their focus is on reducing secondary trauma for the victim, improving conviction rates and reducing the time for finalising cases. "They operate in public hospitals in communities where the incidence of rape is high and they are also linked to the sexual offences courts which is a new South African anti-rape intervention. “Critically, after being raped or sexually assaulted, do not wash or throw away your clothes as there might be hair, blood, saliva or semen on your body or clothes that can be used as evidence to convict the rapist. "Clothes should be wrapped in newspaper, not a plastic bag, which damages the evidence. If you go to the toilet, keep the toilet paper because it is highly likely to contain evidence, allow it to dry and then put it in an envelope or paper bag – not a plastic bag,” Khambi said.
