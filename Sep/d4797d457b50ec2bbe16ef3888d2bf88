Bruwer crossed from France to Monaco, and then to Italy in support of Muzukidz, a Cape Town-based organisation offering children the opportunity to learn the violin. Bruwer, a mother of three and founding member of the multiple award-winning instrumental group Sterling EQ, took seven hours and six minutes to complete the distance. She entered the water on Tuesday at Cap Ferrat just outside Nice in France and finished at Capo Mortola near Ventimiglia in Italy. She briefly stepped on to land in Monaco to log her arrival and did so again when reaching France for the second time. “I am knackered. The conditions were beautiful for the first hour of the swim, but it then became very choppy for the remaining six hours,” she said. Muzukidz provides instrumental tuition to young pupils from disadvantaged communities. Bruwer’s ultra-distance and extreme swims have been done under the banner of “Swim For Hope”, a fundraising platform she founded in 2013. “I believe that giving a child the opportunity to learn a musical instrument goes way beyond the ability to make music or the possibility of being a musician one day. "Music stimulates the brain in a very special way; in fact, studies have shown that children who do 14 months of musical training displayed more powerful structural and functional brain changes. "Imagine what this can do for a young child who comes from a poor background and who has limited opportunities and a limited support structure. "I am convinced that organisations like Muzukidz are helping to mould our future leaders, inventors and change-makers,” Bruwer said.
