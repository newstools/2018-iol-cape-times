A female biker was shot and seriously injured on the N1 on Friday afternoon after she had experienced problems with her motorbike and had to stop. Western Cape Traffic Chief Kenny Africa said the woman – who has yet to be identified – was attacked and shot in the stomach under the N7 bridge, News24 reported. That stretch of freeway and interchanges is a major link to suburbs such as Goodwood, Bellville and the Century City area, with the N7 going to Malmesbury and the N1. "A woman who had problems with her motorbike under the N7 bridge on the N1 was attacked and was shot in the stomach," said Africa. "She was seriously injured." Traffic was backed up for kilometres as the crime scene was cordoned off for further investigation. There were reports that she was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital, but this could not be confirmed by police.
