The residents were joined by neighbouring communities as they protested against crime and gang violence. The move came a day after Police Minister Bheki Cele released the annual crime statistics, indicating that 83% of murders related to gang violence were committed in the province during the last financial year. Religious leaders prayed for the communities while those who had lost their loved ones shared stories. Some carried pictures of those killed after being caught in cross-fire. Resident Melanie Paulse said her wounds were opened as she remembered her 26-year-old brother who was killed on June 26. “It is always the innocent people that get hurt. These shootings are destroying families and taking away breadwinners with bright futures. "We are tired of living in fear and are saying enough is enough. Our rights are being violated every day,” said Paulse. Bishop Lavis police station commander Brigadier Christopher Jones accepted and signed the memorandum of demands. Residents demand police visibility at schools and surveillance cameras in hotspots. Unhappy Gangsterism Must Fall co-ordinator Valentino Stander said: “We are unhappy to see the large police presence because they are never available when there is ongoing shooting. Where do they come from now?”
