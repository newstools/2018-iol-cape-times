The Red Ants removed shacks in Hermanus again on Thursday – the same day land activist and Correctional Services officer Gcobani Ndzongana was released on R5 000 bail. "They are demolishing," said Sicelo Gxamesi, a member of the Zwelihle Renewal Committee (ZRC), as the Red Ants removed a new settlement that sprung up in Zwelihle, News24 reported. In pictures posted by the Red Ants earlier on Thursday, a block of structures made of corrugated iron was being removed as a group stood at a distance and watched. Ndzongana was released from Pollsmoor Prison after his lawyer, Thulasizwe Twalo, successfully appealed against an earlier court decision which denied him bail. Last week, charges of crimen injuria were withdrawn against him in the Hermanus Magistrate's Court. However, he was kept in custody pending the malicious damage and incitement matter. That case, which is back in court in October, relates to the alleged removal of a fence.
