Law Enforcement auxiliary members, the SAPS and the local neighbourhood watch thwarted a crowbar gang attempting to escape with a vehicle full of stolen goods in Plumstead on Thursday, the City of Cape Town said. The gang of five males had just left a property in Hanley Road in Plumstead when they were spotted by the neighbourhood watch patroller. Law Enforcement took up the chase on the M5 from Dick Burton Road towards Kenilworth and was joined by the SAPS. The gang stopped the vehicle on the M5 and two of them fled into a nearby property. The other three suspects sped off in the vehicle in an attempt to confuse their pursuers. The SAPS pursued the vehicle, which they managed to stop in Racecourse Road in Kenilworth, and arrested the three suspects. Law Enforcement focused on the two on foot and apprehended them inside the private property they attempted to hide in. "Great teamwork once again showing that a combined effort from all roleplayers can achieve outstanding results in the fight against crime. Another crowbar gang effectively dismantled," the City said. On Wednesday, City Law Enforcement officers arrested a 30-year-old suspect in Culemborg for being in possession of mandrax and dagga, as well as $9 600 in counterfeit money. "The Culemborg area is a hot spot for criminal activity and this arrest sends out a message to those with criminal intent that their actions will not be tolerated," the City said.
