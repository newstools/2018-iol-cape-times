As part of the Mandela Centenary celebrations this year and Tourism Month, they also learnt about how Cape Town formed part of Madiba’s life. Hosted by Cape Town Tourism, the roadshow was used as an educational tool for pupils to understand more about their city. Cape Town Tourism chief executive Enver Duminy said: “We must make tourism inclusive and accessible to everyone in our city. "Our young people may never have had the chance to gain this kind of perspective on our heritage and natural environment. "Our goal is to showcase the exciting world of tourism and provoke interest in our young people, with a view to attracting some to join the industry, or at the very least to become exploring enthusiasts. Just as children are a central element to Madiba’s legacy, it's our responsibility to engage with the youth.” Cape Town Tourism said its team accentuated that loving Cape Town and loving their area would result in positive changes not only socially but economically. “Areas like Langa, Khayelitsha, Gugulethu, etc, have seen phenomenal changes following the implementation of tourist activities that work to better the community as a whole." The roadshows showcased different job opportunities within the tourism sector, with examples of career paths that can be followed, for example, being a chef, working at the Two Oceans Aquarium and doing social media, etc. “The whirlwind tour saw the group of pupils exploring the Two Oceans Aquarium, where they went on an educational tour of the aquarium, taking in the marine life. "They were joined by a guide who told them about Robben Island and Nelson Mandela’s imprisonment there. They then departed for Table Mountain Aerial Cableway to enjoy a scenic view of the Mother City."
