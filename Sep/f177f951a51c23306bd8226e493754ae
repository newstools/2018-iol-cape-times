The show will take place at the Roxy Revue Bar at Grand West from tomorrow until Saturday. About 70 students from the Cape Music Institute will take audiences on a musical journey through history as they pay tribute to local artists including Brenda Fassie, Mango Groove, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Jimmy Nevis and Lira. Principal Bradley Adams said: “The show birthed two years ago. It was a concept of (musical director) Camillo Lombard to showcase South African music. “It fits in with our ethos because we are an original school, we write original material. We want to get our children away from American songs and show our own talent.” First-year students will perform a set with music from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; second-year students will do a set focused on the 1990s to the 2000s. Adams said: “Expect to be entertained with songs you can relate to and enjoy. Many people underestimate our music, but it is regarded highly by international standards and it brings something different - that uniquely African vibe.” The show will feature a full band comprising drums, bass, guitar, vocals, keys and brass. It is one of three big concerts the students put on every year as part of their performance training. “They are practising around the clock to deliver the best. This is an opportunity for our highly talented students to get the exposure they deserve and for other people get to see them,” said Adams. Tickets are R100 and are available through info@capemusicinstitute.co.za or at 021 637 0327 / 082 374 5791.
