A woman has been arrested after stabbing her allegedly abusive boyfriend to death. The incident happened in Delft on Saturday afternoon, the Daily Voice reported. According to witnesses, the couple, both aged 25, were “heavy drinkers”, who regularly had lovers’ quarrels, “which usually ended in the woman getting beaten up”. However, on Saturday she fought back and allegedly killed the man. The couple had apparently had an argument in Bakkiesblom Street, Roosendal, when things got heated and the man struck her several times. A witness says the woman was injured, but she then allegedly grabbed a knife and stabbed the unsuspecting boyfriend once in the chest. “He died on the scene as she cried over his body,” says the witness. A neighbour says the woman appeared shocked at what she had done. “I know she did not mean it. She loved him and he had loved her. When the police and the ambulance came he was dead and they had to take her away in the van. It is a very sad day for their families,” the neighbour said. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana says the woman faces a murder charge. “Police responded to the scene at about 5pm and upon their arrival they found the deceased, a 25-year-old man, with a stab wound to his chest.” The suspect is expected to appear at Bellville Magistrate's Court soon.
