The inquest is investigating murder, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice charges, among others. Two police officers who responded to an ATM robbery, which later led to Pumeza Fudumele’s death, testified yesterday. Fudumele, a Dunoon resident, was killed in a hail of bullets while she and colleagues were on their way home after work on February 24, 2016. One of Fudumele’s colleagues was wounded in the shooting. Testifying yesterday, constable Malibongwe Nkanunu denied that he shot a woman, and claimed that it could have been the robbers who shot her.
