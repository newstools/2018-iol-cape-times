Cape Town - The DA says it will lay corruption charges against ANC top officials including embattled ANC MP Vincent Smith, who is facing a probe by Parliament's ethics committee for bribery. Smith has voluntarily excused himself from chairing Parliament committees after allegations emerged that he was paid ‘at least’ R670 000 by Bosasa over the past three years and had accepted security installations at his home valued at R200 000. Smith chaired parliament’s portfolio committee on justice. He also co-chaired the constitutional review committee, looking into the possible amendment of section 25 of the Constitution to allow expropriation of land without compensation. DA MP Steenhuisen who reported Smith to Parliament’s ethics committee said the DA will on Friday lay criminal charges against Smith, ANC National Chairperson Gwede Mantashe, Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, former SAA Chairperson Dudu Myeni and Justice and Correctional Services Deputy Minister Thabang Makwetla. “Criminal charges, in terms of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act (Act 12 of 2004), relate to reports that they unduly accepted security upgrades to their homes from controversial facilities management company Bosasa. “For too long under the ANC national government, corruption and excessive expenditure, in return for favours, has been allowed to flourish. These allegations must be investigated so we can get to the bottom of who paid for the high-tech security upgrades,” said Steenhuisen. In a statement shortly after reports of the donations, Smith admitted that he received payments from Bosasa boss Angelo Agrizzi which he said was for a personal loan to cover his daughter's university fees, but denied receiving CCTV cameras at his home.
