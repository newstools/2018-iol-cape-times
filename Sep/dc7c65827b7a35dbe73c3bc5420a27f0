An online art exhibition has been launched to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease, and artists, students, schools and the public can submit works under the theme "Remembering You". World Alzheimer’s Day is commemorated on Friday and Livewell Villages are launching the online art exhibition in an effort to raise awareness of the impact of Alzheimer’s and dementia on individuals, families and society, Executive officer of the dementia care facility at Livewell Villages, Ivan Oosthuizen, said the theme is open to different interpretations and also invites artists, be they amateur or professional, to evoke memories of a loved one who may be affected by dementia, and find a way of preserving the memory of the person that is distinct from the progressive effects of their condition. “The ephemeral nature of memory is highlighted daily in our work with people living with dementia, the umbrella term for a group of conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterised by symptoms such as progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. “We have therefore decided to set up an online art exhibition that seeks to inspire people to reflect on the essence of memory and trying to capture thoughts and emotions around this abstract concept through artistic expression,” Oosthuizen said. The exhibition is open to a variety of mediums, including paintings and drawings, poetry and prose.
