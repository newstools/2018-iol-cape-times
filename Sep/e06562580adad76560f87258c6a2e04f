Sikhafungana, of Wallacedene, was last seen leaving for night-school classes in Bloekombos on September 12. She has been missing ever since. The young mother’s family said her phone was tracked to Nyanga last week and they hoped the police would act swiftly to locate her. Sikhafungana’s uncle, Michael, said: “We believe we are doing everything in our power to bring her back. The police have asked us to give them space to do their work, so we are leaving everything in their hands. We are all trying to be strong for Anathi’s mother.” Anyone with information can call Crime Stop 086 001 0111 or SMS Crime Line 32211.
