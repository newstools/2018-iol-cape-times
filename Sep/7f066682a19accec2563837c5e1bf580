Chairperson of the District Six Beneficiary and Development Trust Dr Anwah Nagia said they are deeply disappointed. “We condemn in the strongest terms the callous nature of the ex-minister of rural development overzealously applying the law in evicting this family who are legitimate claimants. “The Williams family qualify to stay on this property. "We are aware that we had an acrimonious fight with regards to waiting lists, but many of the families in this block are facing the same future.” The Williams family said they were told by the late Sedick Christians, a trustee of the District Six Beneficiary and Development Trust in 2013, that they would be allocated an apartment in District Six following their land claim application. Christians handed them the keys in April 2014 at the District Six community offices and they moved in. However, on May 23, 2014, they were informed by officials from the Land Claims Commission that they were illegally occupying the flat and told to vacate the property. The department, in court papers, stated that the flat was not allocated to the Williams family. After being forced to move out of District Six in 1973, he lodged a claim in 1998. But after a Western Cape High Court ruling that the families vacate their home by March 31, 2017, they took the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Department of Rural Development argued the property belonged to Achmat Matthews, whose land claim was lodged in 1995. Williams struggled to hold back his tears. “We have nowhere to go and I refuse to go. I won’t move from this house. How can they do this to a person. It’s inhumane." @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
