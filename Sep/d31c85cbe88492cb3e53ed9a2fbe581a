The Bellville and Bloekombos-Wallacedene taxi ranks have been reopened, the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works announced on Thursday. Department spokesperson Jandré Bakker said on Thursday the reopening followed an agreement between the department, the SAPS, the Bloekombos-Wallacedene Taxi Association (Bloewata) and the Bellville Taxi Association (Bellta), News24 reported. "The taxi ranks have been open from 15:00 this afternoon," Bakker said. The announcement comes five days after Western Cape Transport MEC Donald Grant said the ranks would be closed indefinitely. The Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) had also said the Bellville taxi rank would stay closed until Bellta and Bloewata could reach an agreement over routes. The closure of the rank was as a result of a shooting between the rival groups last week, which ended with two innocent commuters being wounded and needing medical attention. Another man shot at police and was subsequently wounded in the shootout. The motive for the shootings is being probed. Bellville residents said the closure of the major interchange had had a negative impact on their community. The taxi rank is one of the biggest in the Western Cape after the Cape Town CBD rank. Taxis had started wandering into residential areas, lining up along a bridge, taking up an entire traffic lane, since the closures.
