A young father from Bonteheuwel was buried on Tuesday after he was gunned down while delivering nappies for his three-year-old son. The family of Moegamat Imtiyaaz Jedaar, 24, says they are baffled by the shooting in Camelia Street on Monday, which left him bleeding to death in the road. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana says police were called to the scene at 10.20pm. “Upon their arrival, they found a 24-year-old man who was shot and fatally wounded by unknown suspects who are yet to be arrested. Police detectives are following up on possible leads.” Father Shahied, 54, says he got a fright when a relative told him to rush to Bonteheuwel. “I live in Mitchells Plain and Imtiyaaz works with me at Lentegeur Pharmacy,” he explains. “I got the call and rushed through. I saw he was lying dead. We asked questions, but Imtiyaaz was all on his own and we found it very strange.” Shahied says he was told that Imtiyaaz had walked from his home in Jakkalsvlei Avenue to his son’s grandmother’s home to drop off nappies, but was unsure if he was alone. “Imtiyaaz has two sons, one is in Grade R and the one is three years old,” says the dad. “He went to the house of the baby’s grandmother to drop off nappies, but we don’t know if he was walking with people or on his own. “We are very confused because people could not tell us what led up to the shooting, but it seems like he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” Shahied says he spent the entire day on Monday with Imtiyaaz doing deliveries and was confused because his son “talked funny” as if he had a premonition of his death. “He is a general worker at the pharmacy and had been working with me since the beginning of the year,” he says. “I spent the whole day with him doing deliveries and he was talking very funny, telling me that he was going to bring the children to me. He was just talking funny and then this happened.” Daily Voice
