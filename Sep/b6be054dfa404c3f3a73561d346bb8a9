A tourist from Israel on holiday in Plettenberg Bay had to be rescued after an approximately 3m fall from a ledge on the Robberg Nature Reserve hiking trail on Tuesday. The tourist sustained a laceration above her eye and arm and shoulder injuries, which necessitated National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Plettenberg Bay duty crew to activated. Her husband and son were not injured. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said a rescue crew responded by road and hiked to the scene to join Plettenberg Bay Nature Conservation officers who had also responded. The sea rescue craft Ray Farnham and Free Runner were also launched on the coast of the Robberg Nature Reserve. Lambinon said MCSA (Mountain Club of South Africa) medics also assisted. â€œIt was decided to transport her to our sea rescue base aboard our sea rescue craft Ray Farnham. NSRI thanks the fellow hikers that stopped to help." The tourist's husband and their son left the reserve on foot with the rescue crew and were reunited with the patient in hospital.
