The Overstrand Municipality said it was unsafe for housing. The move to erect the structures was triggered by a lack of progress in addressing housing issues, according to the Zwelihle renewal committee. It said the residents had since been placed in a community hall. “We first want to make it clear that the land grab did not happen shortly or a day before the leader Gcobani Ndzongana was released on bail. "The structures have been there for more than a week, the residents believe the municipality is just playing delay tactics,” said the committee's Siyabulela Notwala. Zwelihle recently made headlines after residents shut down the town and demanded Ndzongana’s release. Ndzongana was released on bail of R5 000 on Thursday, the same day Red Ants removed the structures. He was charged with malicious damage to property and incitement and will be back in court next month. In a statement, the municipality said a number of discussions took place last week with various organisations regarding the situation. “One of the outcomes of this meeting was that the work of the housing task team appointed by the Human Settlements MEC in the Western Cape, Bonginkosi Madikizela, which was temporarily suspended as a result of the unrest in Zwelihle, will recommence urgently,” the municipality said.
