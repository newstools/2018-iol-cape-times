Rock art, estimated to date back between 1500 to 2000 years, will also be unveiled. Situated in the Klein Karoo between the Swartberg and Outeniqua mountains, the Gamkaberg Nature Reserve derives its name from the Khoikhoi word “xami”, meaning lion. The reserve, with rugged terrain and deep ravines, was established in 1974 and is home to the endangered Cape mountain zebra. CapeNature chief executive Dr Razeena Omar said there were about 40 rock art sites within the stretch of protected land. “Each of these sites has spiritual significance and records the lifestyles and stories of the Khoi and San people. The bringing together of these two clans is a first of its kind in the Western Cape. " It (the opening of a protected stretch of land) is to recognise and promote the culture and heritage (of the reserve) chiefly, and to work together with the community going forward,” she said. The reserve, encompassing 10 430 hectares, is recognised globally for comprising three biomes, namely fynbos, succulent Karoo and Albany thicket, which blend together to create a unique environment. These biomes are considered to be biodiversity hot spots - regions with a significant reservoir of biodiversity that are under threat. Western Cape environmental affairs and development planning MEC Anton Bredell said: ‘‘The majority of the province’s water-source areas are affected by the same threats that threaten biodiversity elsewhere. "These are alien plant and animal life, human encroachment and agricultural run-off, among others. It is no different here in the Klein Karoo. “We need people to remain interested and invested in their natural environments, so we need to make places like Gamkaberg more and more attractive for tourists, who will bring their tourism dollars to places like these and plough back into the local community. “Without that cash flow, it is increasingly difficult to fund the work CapeNature must do,” Bredell said.
