Since the installation of the intelligent system in 2016, the City said there had been a drop in over-height vehicles getting stuck under or crashing into the bridge. However, despite the warnings, there is still an average of two cases a month. Mayco member for area south Eddie Andrews said the railway bridge crossing in Muizenberg was notorious for crashes because road users often underestimated the height of their vehicles. The 3D laser detection system measures the height of all vehicles approaching the bridge, and should it detect that the vehicle is too big to fit under the bridge, a warning system is activated which in turn triggers two bright orange flashing beacons on a warning signboard. The beacons flash for about 30 seconds to warn the driver that an alternate route should be used and that the vehicle is too high to pass under the railway bridge.
