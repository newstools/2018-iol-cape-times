Adapted and directed by Thokozile Ntshinga, Buzani KuBawo is a drama about love, family relationships and conflicts that arise when traditional expectations clash with changing values. The high-quality production, written by Witness K Tamsanqa, also highlights the power of love and that one is meant to have a chosen one. Ntshinga said: “There are many of the isiXhosa classics that were written and shelved and we feel the messages that were brought by them are relevant now. "By showcasing this classic, we want to show the difference in view of the youth to the older generation with particular reference to isiXhosa culture, which does not always make sense to the youth when compared to the older generation”. The play follows Artscape’s recent successful staging of the production as a set work that was seen by thousands of Grade 11 and 12 Xhosa-speaking pupils from greater Cape Town. Buzani KuBawo will be held from the October 3 to 6 at 7.30pm. Tickets are available at Box Office, Artscape Dial-a-Seat (021 421 7839) and Computicket outlets ranging from R45 to R80.
