Former DA councillor Wilma Brady was on Tuesday handed a suspended sentence following her conviction on one count of fraud and of contravening the Public Finance Management Act. She had falsely claimed she was acting on behalf of the Western Cape government in appointing Lelethu Properties and Developers to build 33 RDP housing for more than R3 million in the Malibu area in Blue Downs in 2006. Brady was given 10 years' imprisonment for fraud, wholly suspended for five years on condition she does not commit fraud or theft during that period, as well as two years' correctional supervision by the Bellville Specialised Commercial Crime Court. She also received a R10 000 fine for contravening the Public Finance Management Act. The former DA councillor last month tearfully implored the Bellville Commercial Crimes Court not to send her to jail. She made the plea while testifying in mitigation of sentence following sentencing proceedings. Lelethu’s Faizel Davids asked the court to hand down a sentence that carried a jail term and included financial compensation for his losses.
