Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a 31-year-old man after his body was found in Macassar, near Somerset West, on Sunday. A Bangladeshi man was shot dead, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut told News24. "No one has been arrested as yet," he said. Last month, Robert Sonnekus’s body was found at a sand mine in Macassar. His vehicle was recovered in Mitchells Plain after it had been stripped in nearby bushes. It was previously reported that three men had been arrested for possession of stolen property. A 34-year-old man was also arrested, but police were unable to confirm whether he was being charged with armed robbery or murder. The suspect has been released on early parole. On Saturday, a man in his thirties was shot dead in Camps Bay. Traut told News24 that a 45-year-old suspect had been arrested following the incident. "We suspect it was taxi-related or a robbery," Traut said. "At around 18:00, three men approached a taxi in Victoria Street in Camps Bay and there was an altercation, followed by a shooting." According to Traut, the victim has yet to be identified. The shooting is being investigated.
