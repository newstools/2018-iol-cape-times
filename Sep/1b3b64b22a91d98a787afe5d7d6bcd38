A 21-year-old suspected drug dealer led metroÂ police officers straight to his house and a big stash of dagga. Officers on patrol in Kleinvlei on Wednesday night spotted the suspect running away after he had noticed them and gave chase. He was arrested in a flash and on searching him officers detected a dagga smell coming from the house he ran to, the City of Cape Town said. They requested permission to search the premises and found a substantial amount of dagga hidden in a 20-litre drum. The officers confiscated 191 parcels of differing sizes, 12 dagga cigarettes and R275 in cash. The suspect was arrested on a charge of dealing in drugs and detained at the Kleinvlei SAPS. Meanwhile, in Lavender Hill on Wednesday morning, officers arrested a 27-year-old alleged gang member for possession of 11 packets of tik and 40 mandrax tablets. They made the bust while following up on a tip-off about illegal activities at a house in the area.
