Metro police officers arrested four suspects for the illegal possession of two firearms on Monday afternoon. Officers were doing crime-prevention patrols in Netreg when they spotted the group loitering along Robert Sobukwe Road near the N2 bridge. When officers approached them, the foursome ran away, but they were soon cornered. Officers spotted two of the men ditching firearms – one onto the roof of a nearby house and the other decided to throw his weapon under the metro police vehicle. The officers recovered both firearms – a chrome Canik 9mm pistol, without a serial number, and 16 rounds of ammunition, and a Norinco 9mm pistol with a serial number and eight rounds of ammunition. The suspects, three of them aged 22- and one 23-year-old, were arrested and detained at the Bishop Lavis police station. The Metro Police Department arrested 15 suspects for possession of drugs since last night. In Kraaifontein at the weekend, officers searched a well-known drug outlet and arrested a suspect found with 12 packets of tik underneath his pillow. Another stop-and-search resulted in officers confiscating a homemade firearm and two rounds of ammunition. The suspect got away.
