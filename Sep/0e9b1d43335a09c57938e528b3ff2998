Ten young rhino warriors have been selected to join 11-year-old anti-poaching activist Hunter Mitchell at the Aquila Private Game Reserve to celebrate the rhino, and come up with ways the youth can use their voices to save these majestic animals. Hunter put his challenge on the Aquila Private Game Reserve Facebook page earlier this month for children under 18 to submit video entries stating why they should be chosen. It received over 20 000 views, with 88 shares and 77 comments and videos from children across the metro. On World Rhino Day this Saturday, the warriors will visit Aquila for a rhino conference. Hunter chose Lucille Septoe, Rafiqua Israel, Dorothy Cole, Andhrika Venketas, Bev Ewart Boshoff, Stella Bischoff, Cecilia Sani, Avril du Preez and Candice Lee Giloi. “Every single rhino counts and we can all help them in a big or small way, and we need to before it’s too late. My goal for World Rhino Day is to bring together an amazing group of young people who want to help take responsibility for the future of our rhino and stand up for our rhino,” he said. The young activist said he was “looking forward to celebrating our rhino, teaching the warriors more about rhino and showing them rhino in the wild”. “Keeping rhinos, elephants, lions, pangolins and so many more animals safe from extinction needs warriors.”
