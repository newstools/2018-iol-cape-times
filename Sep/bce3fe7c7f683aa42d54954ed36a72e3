The Western Cape Education Department says its school admissions management information (Sami) data indicates that 8 101 places are blocked by parents who have not accepted their placements yet for next year. Sami can determine whether learners have been captured twice or more on school admission lists. “These are cases in which learners have been accepted to more than one school. Therefore their names appear on multiple admission lists, thus blocking potential placements for learners on waiting lists,” said Education MEC Debbie Schäfer. In Grade 8, at least 5 000 learners had been accepted at more than one school, she said. “We appeal to parents of learners who have been accepted at more than one school to contact their school of choice within 10 school days or face losing places at all the schools they have applied (to).” More than a million learners started the 2018 school year, while 106 015 Grade 1s began school across the province.
