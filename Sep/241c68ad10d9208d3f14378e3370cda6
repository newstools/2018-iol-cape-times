The case against rape and murder accused Carlo de Kock has been postponed to October 12 for further investigation and for outstanding reports to be gathered. De Kock, accused of raping and murdering his 10-year-old niece Charnelle McCrawl, made his first Western Cape High Court appearance on Friday morning. The State said it would be revisiting two sexual assault cases against De Kock committed with his biological daughter. Charnelleâ€™s lifeless body was found at a wetlands in Manenberg on October 21 last year - a day after being reported missing when the diligent pupil had not arrived at school. The Grade 4 Edendale Primary School pupil was found wrapped in a plastic bag and a curtain. A forensics report showed she suffered multiple blunt-force injuries to her head, neck and genital areas. De Kock and his then co-accused, Stanton Mano, were arrested after police found traces of human blood in a wheelie bin in Audrey Court, Manenberg. Mano was released from custody during July after the charges against him were dropped, leaving De Kock to face the charges.
