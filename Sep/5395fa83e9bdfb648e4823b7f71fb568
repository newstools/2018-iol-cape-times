Zimbabwe-born US citizen and virologist Bere, who was South African branch chief attached to the Centre for Disease Control and tasked with the role of overseeing donated funds, allegedly misused about R25 million for personal gain. Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said more arrests could not be ruled out. Nkwalase said the funds, meant to be redistributed to deserving NGOs to fight the spread of diseases by providing health care services to key groups and individuals, were donated from the US. Nkwalase said further allegations were that the funds were injected to one deserving NGO, which was later coerced to take up another separate NGO as a subsidiary. “The funds from the subsidiary were allegedly used for personal gain and further transferred to a personal account,” he said. Bere was arrested at the Beitbridge border post at the end of last month while allegedly on his way to neighbouring Zimbabwe, following a warrant of arrest issued against him, said Nkwalase. He said the arrest was as a result of diligent investigation by the Hawks through two search and seizure operations conducted in October 2017 and August 2018. Bere is expected to be back at court during December. Staff Writer
