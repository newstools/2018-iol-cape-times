The officer, who wants to remain anonymous for fear of further victimisation, has lodged a complaint with the City as there was also no ventilation. She worked as an internal investigator and was moved to the room after she reported the assault by her superintendent. The City said the move was in the officer’s “best interests”. “Everyone is talking about the fire that happened in Joburg and the Denel explosion, but Wayne le Roux put a female officer in a fire-hazard room for lodging a sexual assault complaint,” the aggrieved investigator said. Le Roux, the executive director for safety and security, is alleged to have dismissed her complaint and now faces a charge of victimisation. After the Cape Times sent questions to the City, the officer said management had requested that the wires be covered with plastic. The City has denied the room is unsafe. “The facility management section carries out regular inspections and convenes occupational health and safety meetings, and would never have allowed exposed electrical wiring to be left unattended for an extended length of time,” the City said. “It was a harmless network cable which has been tidied up.”
