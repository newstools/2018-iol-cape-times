A Kenilworth woman is alleged to have arranged a hit on her husband. The mother-of-three was arrested in October 2016, but now the couple married for more than 10 years wants to have the case dropped. The 44-year-old Petina Coetzee has made representations to the Western Cape Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) on why the case should be dropped, her lawyer, William Booth, said on Friday, News24 reported. "We believe there is no reasonable prospect of success," he said. Police say she was nabbed in a sting operation in the parking lot of the Lansdowne train station after handing over an undisclosed amount of money, believed to be around R200 000, to the “hitman”. She was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and released on R30 000 bail. She denied the allegations. Booth said her husband, Austin Coetzee, also wanted the case to be dropped and had hired a lawyer to make representations. It was previously reported that he wrote to the National Prosecuting Authority in March 2017 to approve reconciliation with his wife. This was after he absolved the State of any responsibility or culpability should something happen to him. At the time, Austin Coetzee told the Western Cape DPP Rodney de Kock in a letter that he did not, for one moment, believe his wife would carry out "anything of this nature". Petina Coetzee appeared in the Western Cape High Court on Friday, where the case was postponed to October 12 for the outcome of a decision on the representations she had made.
