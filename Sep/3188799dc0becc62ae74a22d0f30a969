Cape Town - The Kramat (shrine) of Sheikh Yusuf in Macassar is set to become a national heritage site with nine other Kramats across the country. This was the Heritage Day message from ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte, who was in Cape Town on Monday. “One thing you cannot remove is our heritage. We came from all walks of life and we have to recognise that. Islam has taught us many things. We must recognise Islam as important and we are leading the project to declare this and several other Kramats as heritage sites. We want this project done by next April. This Kramat holds a significant part of our history. This place represents the slaves, and with District Six and the Bo-Kaap, represent the marginalised.” The historic Kramat is one of the South African Muslim community’s holiest places. The sheikh, who was exiled by the Dutch in 1694, came to Strand, although his followers moved further along the coast. After the death of Yusuf, the followers named the place after his place of birth. A representative of the national Arts and Culture Department, Irwin Langeveld, said the process to declare the Kramat a heritage site was moving swiftly. Cape Argus
