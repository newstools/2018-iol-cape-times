The production is under the auspices of the “Second Chance Theatre Project” - a collaborative arts and social justice initiative introduced by the National Institute for Crime ­Prevention and Reintegration of Offenders (Nicro). They have launched a crowdfunding campaign on Backabuddy to raise R15 000 to help with production costs, healthy meals and refreshments at rehearsals and the performance venue, promotional film production and editing, as well as costumes for the performances. The project was introduced by Nicro, through a partnership with the Department of Correctional Services and together with UCT Associate Professor Veronica Baxter from the institution’s Centre for Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies, and aims to challenge the public’s perception of criminals. The staging of the production is done in partnership with the convention centre. Mission (I’m) Possible, is an intimate theatre production that provides a unique glimpse into the lives of prison inmates, which highlights the dreams and aspirations of inmates and demonstrates that each is more than the crime that he or she has committed. The event will take place on Friday and Saturday as part of a two-day event that will also feature an art exhibition showcasing artworks by inmates. Tickets are available through Quicket, accepting donations from as little as R25. Visit https://www.quicket.co.za/events/57945-mission-im-possible/#/
