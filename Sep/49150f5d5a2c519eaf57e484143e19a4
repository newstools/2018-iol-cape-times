A man was killed after being hit by a train at a railway crossing in Heathfield, ER24 spokesperson Ineke van Huyssteen said in a statement. According to Van Huyssteen, the victim, believed to be in his forties, was found lying next to the tracks when paramedics arrived at the scene on Friday night. "The man showed no signs of life and was declared dead on the scene by paramedics," she said. "The exact circumstances surrounding the incident were not known to our paramedics, but police were on the scene for further investigations." On August 8, when a pedestrian was injured after being hit by a train between Southfield and Heathfield in the morning, Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said at the time of the accident: "With every tragic incident of this nature, we remind the public that the rail service is governed by the Legal Succession Act, which prohibits the illegal crossing of railway lines. People who do so expose themselves willingly to unnecessary danger. "Metrorail strongly recommends individuals to desist from endangering their lives by crossing the tracks."
