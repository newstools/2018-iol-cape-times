Dalwai was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while Junaid Shaik received three years' house arrest and Samson Makula 12 months' house arrest. The trio went on trial after Riedoh Hendricks was found burnt and with multiple gunshot wounds in Strandfontein. Charges against Godfrey Owies were dropped. Two other men, Alex Manuel and another man, who were also implicated in the matter, turned State witnesses. Western Cape High Court Judge Elizabeth Baartman had convicted Dalwai of murder, while Shaik and Makula were found guilty of assault with aggravating circumstances and kidnapping. Judge Baartman said both the Section 204 witnesses and Shaik had expressed fear of Dalwai, while Makula, who was employed by Dalwai, remained loyal and reserved his right to testify. After Hendricks was blamed for the burglary, Dalwai sent Manuel to look for him. On arrival, he was placed in a room and beaten with implements. His hands were later tied behind his back with plastic cable ties. “The deceased was screaming 'I won't do it again' and despite offering to show where the stolen tools were, Dalwai kept on hitting with a hammer,” said Judge Baartman. Dalwai then conspired with unknown parties to transport Hendricks to Strandfontein. He was then set alight and later shot multiple times. A pathologist’s report said there was a strong smell of petrol on the burn wounds. Hendricks sustained multiple abrasions and lacerations of blunt-force trauma from a round object. He died due to his gunshot wounds. The judge said Manuel and Shaik testified that Dalwai had threatened them both. "When Manuel was arrested, Dalwai went to visit him in prison and told him to keep quiet, but Manuel refused to be imprisoned for someone else’s doings," Judge Baartman said.
