The rugby fraternity has passed on its condolences to the family of Goodwood Rugby Club player Kyle Barnes. The 31-year-old wing died on Thursday after sustaining a serious head injury in the second half of an away league fixture against Strand United last Saturday. The father of twins – a boy and a girl – had been put on a life-support system earlier this week. His family decided to switch off the life support due to him being declared brain dead. His twins turned eight on the day he passed away. SA Rugby President Mark Alexander told sport24.co.za on Friday: “It is a tragic day when a player loses his life due to a rugby injury and we want to extend our condolences to the family and friends of Kyle Barnes. "We would also like to extend condolences to the Goodwood Rugby Club, his team-mates and their opponents on the day, Strand Rugby Club, as this incident affected all involved. May his soul rest in peace." Goodwood Rugby Club chairperson Johann Vorster said: "The club is incredibly saddened by this tragic event and our condolences are with the family. "He was a great guy, a gentleman and an example to others. He will forever be in our memory." The incident occurred when Barnes went to pick up a ball and the tackler collided with his neck. He was still conscious when taken to hospital. He had to undergo emergency surgery due to swelling on the brain and had a piece of his skull removed to try to reduce it.
