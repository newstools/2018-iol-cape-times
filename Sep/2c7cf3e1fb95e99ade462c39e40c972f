Nominations for a new Cape Town mayor closed yesterday. From now until the end of this month, a screening committee will go through the names to ascertain whether they meet the criteria set out and then determine a shortlist, DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi said. “A selection panel will thereafter interview the candidates and recommend the successful candidate to the federal executive,” Malatsi said. Transport and Urban Development Mayco member Brett Herron has thrown his hat in the ring and says he has “what it takes” to be the next mayor. Current Mayor Patricia de Lille’s last day in office will be on October 31. After almost a year of public infighting, De Lille and the DA reached an agreement last month that will see her quit at the end of next month and have all internal charges dropped against her. De Lille has not revealed what lies ahead for her from November.
