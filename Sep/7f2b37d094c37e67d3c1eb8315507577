The kingpin in a countrywide licensing scam, Elton Abrahams, from Belhar, has been sentenced to five years' direct imprisonment on charges of fraud and corruption. The 33-year-old Abrahams appeared in the Bellville Regional Court on Thursday with his girlfriend, Bronwyn Davids, and a former government employee, Laurelle Richards, the SABC reported. Abrahams is an ex-traffic department employee. A fourth man, Faizel Dollie, a bus company operator, was given a suspended sentence. All four had entered into a plea and sentencing agreement with the State. Abrahams's scam involved issuing clearance certificates for non-roadworthy vehicles. Hawks spokesperson in the Western Cape Philani Nkwalase said more arrests are expected. “We will surely work on ensuring that more suspects are brought to book on this matter, as we know it really compromises the general public. We will continue holding operations to address the scourge of the problem,” Nkwalase said. The Hawks had seized more than R3 million in cash, two cars and several identity documents at his house when he was arrested in November 2016. Abrahams was out on R30 000 bail. A senior traffic official was arrested in De Aar in the Northern Cape just two weeks after the Western Cape Hawks arrested Abrahams at his Belhar home in 2016 for his involvement in the scam.
