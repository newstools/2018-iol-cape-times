Mayor Patricia de Lille says Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is in great spirits after he was admitted to an undisclosed Cape Town hospital yesterday for what his office said were a series of tests before his 87th birthday. He has battled prostate cancer in the past and has undergone intravenous treatment on numerous occasions to treat the infection related to the illness. “He's in great spirits as always. They are doing a range of tests on him," De Lille said after visiting him on Friday, the SABC reported. "They are spoiling him, the nurses and doctor are all around him. He's really also enjoying it. He's in great spirits.” Tutu, who turns 87 in 10 days’ time, hopes to be back home in a few days. His admission to hospital came as preparations were under way for the 8th Desmond Tutu International Peace Lecture to be delivered by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Artscape on October 8. Tutu asked Ramaphosa to reflect in his lecture on restorative justice 20 years after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Since its inauguration in 2011 by the Dalai Lama, who had to be connected to Cape Town by satellite from India, the International Peace Lecture has become a flagship event on the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation’s annual calendar. The list of speakers who have graced the podium includes former first lady Graça Machel, former public protector Thuli Madonsela and the late Kofi Annan.
