Mortimer Saunders's lawyer, Mornay Calitz, closed his case in the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday. He said the man accused of the rape and murder of 4-year-old Courtney Pieters will not testify in his defence, News24 reported. "That is then the case for the defence and we close our case," Calitz said after deciding to not call his client, Mortimer Saunders, to give evidence. Judge Pearl Mantame told the accused: "Your counsel doesn't want to put you on the stand and, as a result, your case has been closed." He was asked if he understood that final arguments would be prepared and that he would return to court for that. Saunders nodded in agreement. The defence and the State are expected to return to court on September 17 to submit their closing arguments in the case. In a written plea, Saunders pleaded guilty to murder but denied raping the toddler. Instead, he claimed he used his fingers to penetrate her after she died. Courtney disappeared from her mother's Elsies River house in May 2017. Her body was later found in Epping, an industrial area in Cape Town. The court previously heard the accused poisoned and choked her, using a towel to cover her mouth. He claimed there had been ill feelings between himself and the child's mother, Juanita.
