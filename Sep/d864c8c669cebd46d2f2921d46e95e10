The NPO, formerly known as the Amy Biehl Foundation, specialises in after-school and youth skills-development programmes for people aged five to 35 living in challenged and highly vulnerable communities in the province. It was named after an American, and Fulbright scholar, Amy Biehl, a young, white anti-apartheid activist who was stoned and stabbed to death in Gugulethu during the 1980s political unrest. It will host its dinner tomorrow night at the Century City Conference Centre from 7pm. Funds will also be used for the foundation’s mission of providing a safe environment in which to develop emotionally well-rounded children and youth in challenged communities. This year’s star-studded line-up of South African performers at the dinner include Vicky Sampson, Larry Soffer, Chasing Time, The Black Ties and 140 Amy Foundation Performing Arts pupils directed by Aviva Pelham and assisted by Roxy Levy, and choreographed by Paul Johnson, said managing director Kevin Chaplin. TV presenter Soli Philander will be the master of ceremonies. “It is only through continued support that we are able to stay true to our mission of providing a safe environment in vulnerable communities where we develop emotionally well-rounded children and youth, who make positive life choices and become contributing members of society and continue the healing that our country so desperately needs,” said Chaplin. Auctioneer Joey Burke will be inspiring guests to dig deep into their pockets to help raise the funds needed to keep running the after-school and youth skills development programmes in the Western Cape townships, said Chaplin.
