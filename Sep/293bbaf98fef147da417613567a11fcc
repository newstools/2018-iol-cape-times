Seven terrified teenagers had to be rescued by the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Gordon’s Bay crew at Dappat se Gat at Kogel Bay on Tuesday when high tide trapped them in a cove. The NSRI crew were activated after being alerted by the parents of one of the teenagers trapped with six other friends, all aged 18, www.capetownetc.com reported. The teens had made their way to the cove in the afternoon and when the tide came in, found themselves stranded. Rescuers had to wade through deep water to reach the group and return them into the arms of their anxious parents. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said: “On arrival, the NSRI personnel rescued the teenagers using ropes and safety equipment.” The NSRI’s sea rescue vehicle and rescue swimmers, as well as a GB Med Security ambulance, Cape Town Traffic Department, Law Enforcement and Metro Police, responded immediately. With daylight fading, efforts to get the teenagers, three males and four females from Stellenbosch and Paarl, quickly to safety became a priority. Their concerned parents arrived on the scene and looked on helplessly. The NSRI rescue swimmers reached the teenagers using the lull in the incoming waves. A rope system was then set up and safety equipment was taken to the cove by rescue swimmers. The teenagers were placed in life jackets and rescue helmets, and eventually reunited with their concerned family members. None of them were injured.
