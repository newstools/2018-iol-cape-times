CPF chairperson Byron de Villiers said a man found the half-naked Lindsay-Dean Opperman Hendricks in a bushy area on Tuesday. “She was still alive when she was found and able to give a brief description of the clothes her attacker was wearing. We condemn the attacks on our women and children and want the community to come forward with information that will lead to the arrest of the suspect,” De Villiers said. According to information, Hendricks was discovered just metres away from where Mitchells Plain resident Bradley Fredericks was found buried. Fredericks, 41, went missing on July 9 and was found buried near his Orpheus Crescent home on July 22. Fredericks’s body was found in a shallow grave in Bergsig Street, about 2km from his home. “Last week we started a campaign calling for peace to be restored to our community. We are appealing to the humanity of people to come on board and join this campaign so we may see our community safe again. We are assisting police in any way we can to help them with this investigation. “It is very unfortunate that these crimes are committed against especially our women and children. We will keep our hands on these cases and keep our law enforcement agencies accountable so that they may give us answers,” De Villiers said. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said: “The circumstances surrounding the death of a (woman) in her twenties is being investigated after she was assaulted and possibly raped by an unknown suspect at around 10.30am (on Tuesday) in Morgan Village, Lentegeur.” Anyone with information about the incident is requested to anonymously contact Crime Stop on 086 0010 111 or SMS Crime Line on 322 111.
