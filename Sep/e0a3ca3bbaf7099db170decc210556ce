A goat found with a knife impaled in its back in Camps Bay at the weekend is recovering at the SPCA. Cape of Good Hope SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham said the goat, which they have named Hilda, is “recovering well”. “The dagger, which was still in situ when she arrived at the SPCA on Sunday, was removed by our vet and Hilda is being monitored for any signs of secondary infection or difficulty with mobility,” Abraham said. Law Enforcement Inspector Wayne Dyason said the goat was found on Sunday. “Law Enforcement officers came across the rather distressing sight of a goat standing among the rocks on the beach with a knife firmly implanted in its back. The officers immediately called the SPCA, who came out and rescued the animal who had lost a lot of blood. “It is suspected the animal was involved in some type of ritual that occurred during the night on the beach but managed to evade its captors. The handle of the knife was wrapped in red cloth material. Every effort will be made by the SPCA to save the animal,” Dyason said. Abraham added: “The dagger used had red cloth tied around the handle and what appears to be hair knotted into it, suggesting that Hilda was intended to be a ritual sacrifice of sorts.” A criminal case could not yet be reported to police, Abraham said, as they had no suspects. “It is a contravention of the Animals Protection Act No. 71 of 1962 to cause an animal to suffer in this manner and it is equally criminal to neglect to seek veterinary assistance for an injured animal. "This is a heartless act by a heartless individual who we hope will soon be brought to book,” Abraham said. Anyone with information relating to this incident is urged to contact the SPCA on 021 700 4158/9 during office hours or 083 326 1604 after hours.
