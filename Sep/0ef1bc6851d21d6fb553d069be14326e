The City of Cape Town is highly encouraged to see dam levels rise above 65% after significant late-winter rainfall. And the good news is that even more rain is on the way. While everyone is hoping for the easing of water restrictions and lowering of water tariffs, it is still a long way off the National Department of Water and Sanitation's target of 85%. According to weather reports, there is at least 25mm of rain predicted for the Cape this week, starting late on Tuesday afternoon. The rainfall will reach the western coast just after 5pm on Tuesday, www.southafrican.com reported. Sweeping across the Cape Peninsula and the Atlantic Seaboard, the cold front will move in a north-easterly direction. Cape Town itself looks set to record anything between 15-25mm of rain before midday on Wednesday. The region between Paarl and Stellenbosch seems to be in for the most rainfall this week. The estimates over the next 48 hours suggest that 35-40mm will fall before Wednesday afternoon. This incoming weather system will persist into the early hours of Wednesday morning, ensuring that the south-west of the Western Cape gets a good dousing.
