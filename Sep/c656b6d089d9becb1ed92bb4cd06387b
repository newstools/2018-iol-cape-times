Police received a complaint from a resident about a man who was reportedly seen at the park with three children on Wednesday. Police would not confirm the ages of the minors. A highly placed police source said the man was allegedly seen removing his pants, whereafter the minors he was with apparently did the same. “(We) can confirm that a case of sexual assault was opened and the circumstances are being investigated, following an incident at around 4.30pm (on Wednesday) in Phumlani Village, Grassy Park, involving three minor children. The unknown suspect has yet to be arrested,” said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel André Traut. Grassy Park Community Policing Forum chairperson Philip Bam said details of the incident were “unclear”. “I have been to the police station since receiving the information and was assured the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit was investigating. "We are aware lots of rumours have been going around on social media and we ask people to be cautious with information that could possibly be inaccurate,” he said. Bam urged social media users to “be mindful of what is shared and to use the platform responsibly” after information about the incident was posted on a Facebook page. “Be that as it may, we are still very concerned about the safety of our children. We want to urge parents to be vigilant and not to let their children play outside unsupervised. As adults we need to take responsibility for our families.” Anyone with information about the incident can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 086 001 0111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
