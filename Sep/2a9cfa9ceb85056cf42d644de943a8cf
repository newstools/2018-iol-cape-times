Sesona Gagana, 15, from Khayelitsha; Anela Gazi, 18, from Mfuleni; Liam Hewitson, 15, from Bergvliet; Emma Hutchison, 16, from Claremont; Sahil Samlal, 16, from Century City; and Duncan Shelver, 16, from Bellville, have their eyes and hearts set on the bright lights of Las Vegas and New York City. These College of Magic students were chosen for the US trip in March because of their passion and dedication to the art of the magic performing arts and have been hard at work preparing for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ever since. College of Magic chief executive Yolandi van Jaarsveldt said: “To travel to the US is every magical performer’s dream and it’s about to come true for our six young magicians. "This is an awesome life-changing opportunity for our students to learn a new culture and experience the broader magical world.” The trip is arranged annually by the College of Magic and this year will see the nation’s youngest illusionists explore Las Vegas and New York through a series of magical, educational and theatrical experiences, including training sessions to further their magical development and meet and greets with some of magic’s greatest performers: Penn and Teller, David Copperfield, Terry Fator and more. The young magicians have been working hard to raise R100 000 through public performances and a public Go Get Funding online campaign. The institution said there was still time for the public to support the teens’ ongoing fundraising campaign: Visit https://gogetfunding.com/project-america-dream-magic/ and donate whatever you can.
