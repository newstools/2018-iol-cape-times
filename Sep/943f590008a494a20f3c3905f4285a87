The colourful, silent peace march to Parliament - involving religious leaders from the Cape Town Interfaith Initiative, the Religious Leaders Forum, traditional leaders, residents, the SA Peace Alliance and the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) - began with interfaith prayers and silent meditation. The march comes in the wake of last week’s release of the country’s national crime statistics by Police Minister Bheki Cele. Charles Ford, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s representative, received a memorandum demanding that the government restore trust by acting against social ills. Cape Town Interfaith Initiative chairperson Berry Behr said: “We are here today to lead our country back to the hope and belief we felt at that time (1996, when the Constitution was promulgated). “Honourable Mr President, with all due respect, it seems that South Africa has wandered very far from the spirit and the letter of that Constitution. “We find ourselves now in an untenable position where the rule of law is replaced by gang rule in our suburbs, where fear stalks every child on every street. As religious leaders, we take this very seriously and believe that we need to have a holistic approach applied in turning this around.” Princess Chantal Revell of Katz Korana royal house said: “These days it’s sad and terrifying to see the current state of the country and of the Western Cape. The injustices happening out there are unbelievable and it’s time to come together to stop this for the benefit of our children.” The spokesperson for the organisers, MJC deputy president Moulana Abdul-Khaliq Allie, said: “There is no other way peace can come but via religions, so that is why we are saying to communities, stand with us so that we can overcome these hurdles we are facing. ‘‘The police have tried and internal security have tried, but when do we put our hands and call on God?”
