Cape Town - A taxi driver was shot in the head, allegedly by a suspect who robbed people in the van along Strandfontein Road in Lotus River on Thursday. The gunman started robbing the passengers in the minibus just after 1pm. The suspect had pretended to be a passenger and when the taxi reached the Klip Road intersection, he began holding the people at gunpoint. But things turned violent when the robber attempted to rob the driver and allegedly shot him in the head. The driver lost control of the taxi after being shot and crashed the van in a ditch. The 34-year-old taxi driver and the suspect, who was injured in the accident, were rushed to hospital. The driver is said to be in a stable condition while the suspect is under police guard in hospital. A source, who had been at the scene, says it’s a miracle no-one died in the incident. “The man started robbing people in the taxi and he wanted to rob the driver as well. “According to the members (cops) at the scene, there were passengers inside the taxi. “The driver sustained a head wound, but we understand the injury is not too serious. “The driver lost control of the vehicle and the passengers were safely removed from the wreckage.” Fortunately, none of the passengers were injured, confirms police spokesperson, Constable Wesley Twigg. “This office can confirm that a case of robbery was opened for investigation after a 34-year-old male was shot and wounded and people were robbed in the taxi on Strandfontein Road at about 1pm.
