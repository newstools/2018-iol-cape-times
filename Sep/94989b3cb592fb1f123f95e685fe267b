Cape Town - Dido Valley Road in Simon’s Town will be closed to traffic between the intersections with Penguin Drive and 1st Avenue from Wednesday, the City of Cape Town has announced. "The closure will take effect on 26 September 2018 for approximately three months to allow for the construction of a new sewer pipeline," the City said in a statement on Friday. "The City of Cape Town apologises for any inconvenience, however, this is a necessary service delivery project for the benefit of the community. Motorists are advised to use the alternative routes along either Glen Road or Scala Road." The project involves the laying of a 400-metre-long sewer pipe at a cost of R1,8 million. Once installed, the sewer pipe will serve the Woodlands community and the new housing development in Dido Valley Road. "We are well aware that the temporary road closure will cause some inconvenience to residents and other road users. However, it is absolutely necessary that the municipality caters for the infrastructure needs of our communities," said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Area South, Councillor Eddie Andrews.
