Johannesburg - State-owned power utility Eskom has implemented Stage 1 rotational load shedding from 9am on Saturday morning and this is likely to continue until 10pm "as we conserve and build reserves for the week ahead and give our maintenance teams space to bring generating units back online", Eskom said. In a statement issued on Saturday morning, Eskom reminded customers to treat all electrical points as live during load shedding. Eskom again apologised for the inconvenience caused. Stage 1 called for 1000MW to be rotationally shed nationally at a given period. Load shedding was conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. "We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand." For Eskom customers, schedules are available on the Eskom website.
