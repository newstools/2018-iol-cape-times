Cape Town – Metrorail says commuters travelling on the Northern line, between the Bellville and Tygerberg stations, can expect significant delays for the next few days. This is due to repair work and the removal of a goods train that derailed which is under way. According to Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott, the process could take several days, the SABC reported. The train was transporting grain and ended up losing its cargo. Scott said this means only one line is in operation. "It looks like it can take several days for the service to recover quickly. The train would have to be rerailed and removed before Transnet technical teams can do a proper assessment of any underlying damage to the track," Scott said. In the meantime, Scott said, Metrorail is able to operate but there is only one line in operation. Therefore, there is a stop-go situation in place in which the set of tracks is being shared in both directions, which will add at least 60 minutes to commuters' travelling time.
