Dredging the high spots was a necessity ahead of an oil-drilling expedition from this month to March by petroleum refining company Total, where supply vessels that support the activity will be utilised. Port manager Shadrack Tshikalange said: “The Port of Mossel Bay has some high spots in the entrance channel, and the sand trap is full. The high spots in the channel pose a navigational risk, especially during low tides.” Transnet said benefits of dredging the areas would be an entrance channel that is dredged to the designed depth, and all high spots - which would have posed a navigational risk - would be removed. The dredged sand trap will then again have capacity for the migrating sand to not settle in the entrance channel of the port. Of Total’s local oil drilling expedition, Tshikalange said TNPA was supportive of the initiative, as positive results would contribute towards unlocking the economic potential of South Africa’s oceans and subsequent job creation as part of Operation Phakisa.
