Cape Town - Commuters have experienced delays of up to an hour after a Transnet Freight Rail train derailed between Bellville and Tygerberg train stations. No deaths or injuries have been reported. A service recovery was underway earlier on Monday on Wellington, Kraaifontein, Muldersvlei and Strand train stations. These trains are resuming normal operational schedule. "Earlier Transnet Freight Rail train derailment between Bellville/Tygerberg impacts Northern line train service. Single line working and speed restrictions implemented between Elsies River and Bellville. Allow for extended travel time of 60+ min," said Metrorail in a tweet. Prasa is set to implement their first step of its plan for a modernised railway infrastructure for a safer, faster, smoother and world class train service this week. Thousands of Cape Town commuters will be affected by these upgrades.         “Southern Line trains will use platforms one to five. Northern [Line] trains, including the businesses expresses, will utilise platform six to nine. The Cape Flats [line] trains will use platforms 10 and 11. Mitchells Plain [(the central line)] trains will use platform 12,” said Metrorail spokesperson, Riana Scott.
