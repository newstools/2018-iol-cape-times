Police used stun grenades to disperse the group. One person was arrested and others sustained minor injuries. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said at the time: “Public Order Police Service (POPS) and other law enforcement agencies are monitoring the situation near the Civic Centre, where a group of about 100 MyCiTi bus drivers were striking. Police took action to disperse the crowd.” The employees, on an unprotected strike since October, want to be directly employed by the City and demand equal pay. The City said it was bound to the vehicle operating companies for the next 12 years, meaning insourcing of the workers was impossible. One of the workers, Thandikhaya Chizama, said: “I won’t mind dying for my children’s future because the business was meant to help people and now it’s not happening. We will fight until the last drop of blood.” Transport mayoral committee member Felicity Purchase said the City was granted an urgent interdict by the Western Cape High Court on December 10. “The order prevents former employees of the contractors operating the MyCiTi service, or anyone associated with them, from entering the civic centre, or any other building owned or under the control of the City of Cape Town, except for the purpose of conducting ordinary business.” Cape Times
