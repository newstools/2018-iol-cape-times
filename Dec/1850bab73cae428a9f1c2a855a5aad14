A father and son who capsized in a canoe about 500m from shore have also not been seen since they entered the water in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said that around 6.30pm on Saturday the teen disappeared under the surf at Milnerton Lagoon. “An extensive air, sea and shoreline search for the male from Parow has revealed no sign of him and a police dive unit will continue in an ongoing search operation. “It appears that the teenager and a 16-year-old male friend were swimming in the surf when the teenager went missing after a wave washed over them and he failed to resurface. His friend raised the alarm,” Lambinon said. Issuing a spring tide warning last week the NSRI urged public caution around the coast, as the full moon takes effect. Lambinon had said the alert applied from tomorrow, when the full moon spring tide will bring a higher than normal high tide and a lower than normal low tide. Anglers fishing along the coast, bathers, beach walkers and coastal hikers were urged to be cautious, Lambinon said.
