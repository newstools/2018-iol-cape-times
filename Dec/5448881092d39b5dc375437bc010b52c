Cape Town – The National Sea Rescue Institute says their pink rescue buoy, which was removed on Wednesday night in Jeffreys Bay, has been returned. CCTV cameras had captured four teenagers – three young boys and a girl – removing the life-saving device from its post at Point Beach, Wavecrest on Wednesday night. "A young man has apologised and the Pink Rescue Buoy at Point Beach has been returned. It will be back in place today. Thank you to everyone who has shared and helped spread the word," the NSRI said yesterday. The luminous pink life-saving floatation devices are unique to the NSRI and have to date saved 16 lives. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon says the buoy was returned to NSRI station 37 at J Bay. Yesterday, the NSRI had appealed to the four teenagers and anyone who knew them to return it to its post. The NSRI also thanked Deon Coetzer, of Seaport Supply, Paarden Eiland, whose intervention led to the recovery of another pink rescue buoy in Paarden Island on Thursday. "Deon noticed a man carrying a pink rescue buoy into Paarden Island, Cape Town, this morning, Thursday, 13th December. "Deon stopped the man and asked him to hand it over as it was clearly one of the NSRI’s pink rescue buoys and should be returned to its position so that it could be used in a rescue. “With community backing like this, the Pink Rescue Buoy campaign, which has already helped to save 16 lives, will go from strength to strength,” said the NSRI’s drowning prevention manager, Andrew Ingram.
