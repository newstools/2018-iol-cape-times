Cape Town – Brian Wainstein's killer, Matthew Breet, was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment on Wednesday. In a plea agreement with the State, the 28-year-old Breet had pleaded guilty to murder. The court also declared him unfit to possess a firearm His brother, Sheldon Breet, as well as Fabian Cupido and Cheslin Adams's case was separated from his last Friday and they will appear in court again on February 8, Netwerk24 reported. The murder of the FBI’s most-wanted “Steroid King” in his Constantia home was an underworld hit plotted and facilitated by his two trusted bodyguards, Weekend Argus reported. This was just one of the startling allegations in the State’s case against his sibling protectors and two Cape Flats gangsters accused of the killing of Wainstein in August last year, which rocked Hohenort Avenue’s suburban bliss. The State’s summary of the conspiracy reads like a plot outline for a Hollywood gangster movie or series. It starts in a Mitchells Plain tyre dealership where the boss and bodyguard Matthew Breet are alleged to have hatched the plot. Seven days later on August 17, the day of the hit, the tyre boss, his associates, 27 gangsters’ Fabian Cupido and Cheslyn Adams (also a Spoilt Bratz gang member), met Wainstein bodyguard and business associate Sheldon Breet. Adams was nominated as the triggerman and Cupido the getaway driver, the State alleges. At about 9pm, the gangsters and a third man who has turned State witness reconnoitred Wainstein’s luxury home at 29 Hohenort Avenue. Later, Adams and Cupido took delivery of their getaway car, a VW Golf GTI, near the N1 Century City off-ramp. There Breet allegedly provided the hitmen and the unnamed State witness with a detailed layout of Wainstein’s home. Adams and the State witness later entered the house undetected and made their way to the main bedroom where, prosecutors claim, Adams shot at Wainstein’s head. A post-mortem revealed Wainstein died from multiple gunshot wound injuries to the neck extending to the base of the brain. The indictment alleges that there had been no attempt to disguise the hit as a house invasion with just R100 and seven cellphones removed after the hit. Sources claim the phones contained incriminating evidence of Wainstein’s underworld links. Later the Breet brothers arrived at the crime scene, where Matthew answered Cupido’s call to find out if “the mission was accomplished”, claims the State. There’s no mention of motive in the State’s summary. But in other court hearings this year, it emerged that Wainstein had been involved in the turf war over Cape Town’s nightclub protection and extortion racket. Shortly before his death, he was trying to find out who had ordered a hit on him. “You’re a f ***ng dead bastard‚ you c***.” These were among the last words Wainstein is purported to have said to alleged Cape Town underworld boss Mark Lifman, TimesLive reported. Hours after a heated phone call between the two men‚ Wainstein was shot dead in bed at his Constantia home‚ where he was sleeping between his fiancée and child. In an audio recording played in Cape Town Magistrate’s Court in February‚ a smooth voice with a preppy Cape Town English accent – alleged to belong to Lifman – told Wainstein: “You guys were told to be careful with who you do business‚ now you’re talking with that other little f***ker.” In the recording‚ said to have been made on August 17‚ 2017, he also called Wainstein‚ a man of Irish descent‚ a “fat peasant fuck”. Wainstein replied: “You’re a f***ing dead bastard you c***‚ you f****t. Come‚ I’m waiting for you. I’m in Cape Town.” The exchange was played during the bail application of five men alleged to be involved in a war for control of the Cape Town nightclub extortion racket. Nafiz Modack‚ Colin Booysen‚ Ashley Fields‚ Jacques Cronje and Carl Lakay were arrested on December 15, 2017. Lakay’s lawyer‚ Rooshdeen Rudolph‚ introduced the recording into evidence in an attempt to show Lifman had played a role in the group’s arrest and was operating in opposition to them. Wainstein, a dual South African and Israeli citizen, was one of the biggest players in the steroid black market, according to steroid.com. He was top of Interpol’s most-wanted list for dealings in Germany, Canada and the US.
