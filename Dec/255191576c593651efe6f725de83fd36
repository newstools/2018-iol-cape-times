Cape Town – Some Twitter users have taken exception to Premier Helen Zille raving about Cape Town being voted the greatest city on Earth in the Telegraph Travel Awards survey for 2018. This is the sixth year in a row that the Mother City has claimed the top spot. The Telegraph Travel Awards performs an annual survey to find out Telegraph Travel readers’ favourite cities. More than 45 000 readers of the conservative UK publication took part in the Travel Awards survey, with Cape Town beating popular cities such as New York and Tokyo.     congratulations to everyone in the magnificent Mother City. Let's make it great for everyone. https://t.co/UDJq4ITyED "Congratulations to everyone in the magnificent Mother City. Let's make it great for everyone," Zille tweeted on Tuesday. But many Twitter users did not share Zille's view due to the racism and inequality still prevalent in the city. @ntsekisang tweeted: "It is a beautiful city, problem is you always show the beach and nice luxurious beach houses except for the shacks that are overcrowded. Are you afraid that the shacks will ruin the nice image of Cape Town?" "I doubt the people of Mitchells Plain would agree. But I am sure the madam doesn't consider them as part of Cape Town," noted @Qryptonic.     “Let’s make it great for everyone” indeed.Kazi ubani obe vota smakade? 🤨😏 pic.twitter.com/SCswi022Z7 @Michellezozo tweeted: "Pity the racism outweighs the beauty of the city." @zishgirl123 wrote: "Great in which way? Because it is the most racially divided city I know." @MrNguni said: "Greatest city for who?"     Janine Myburgh, president of the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry, commenting on the accolade, said: “We should bear in mind that we are being judged largely as a holiday city and as a summer refuge for 'swallows' from the northern countries. “This is also a great compliment to the people of Cape Town who have made visitors so welcome. As a city, we still have many challenges ahead of us, but this accolade should spur us on to extend the City’s international appeal well beyond the tourist season.”
