The City has also warned that drivers of light-motor vehicles using the heavy-vehicle lane and failing to comply with the stop line there would also not be exempt from being fined. The City said its recent completion of the installation of the final phase of a hi-tech automated camera enforcement system relates to the compulsory heavy-vehicle stop on the Ou Kaapse Weg approach to Steenberg Road. The system is capable of capturing transgressions and is expected to improve traffic safety. Mayoral Committee Member for Transport and Urban Development Felicity Purchase said the road’s signage was revised in response to feedback from motorists who indicated they did not understand the signage. The upgraded signage system comprises two sets of signage conveying what actions are expected from the drivers of light motor-vehicles and heavy vehicles. “The signs are repeated three times in each case. Relevant regulatory signs are also displayed at appropriate positions. We’ve opted to upgrade signage to exceed the minimum standards in a bid to achieve greater levels of compliance and in the interest of road safety,” said Purchase. The safety measures were intended to drastically reduce the incidence of runaway heavy vehicles, Purchase said.
