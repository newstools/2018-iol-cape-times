The family had last month rushed the turtle to the local NSRI base, which immediately contacted the Two Oceans Aquarium. The family then brought the turtle to the aquarium, where experts immediately started treatment according to rehabilitation protocols. The green sea turtle was very weak, but stable, on arrival, and didn’t have too many external growths and only minor visible injuries. The aquarium team proceeded with treatment but very quickly realised that the turtle showed signs of laboured breathing. “Suspecting a possible lung infection or pneumonia, we started with antibiotics and supportive medication. Over the next couple of days we noticed that the turtle was becoming weaker,” the aquarium team said. “Five days after its arrival, a barium study was done to investigate if the turtle possibly had a blockage. We were able to confirm that the turtle indeed had some kind of obstruction in its oesophagus.” Specialised equipment was needed to help the turtle. The aquarium’s endoscope was too short, had no gripping ability and one can also not blow air through it, which was necessary to move the barium. “Over the next couple of days we contacted a number of vets. We established that Dr Malan van Zyl at the Cape Animal Medical Centre has the only endoscope in Cape Town which fits the criteria of being thin enough, long enough, can blow air and has gripping abilities. He kindly offered to help and fitted us into his very busy schedule. “The turtle is still in critical condition. We are monitoring it as part of our turtle rehabilitation and release programme, and will continue to administer medication and treatment as needed,” the aquarium said.
