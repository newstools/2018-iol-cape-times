The City’s environmental health department had sent the mosque a noise abatement notice this week, stating the loudspeaker was in contravention of the Noise Control Regulation. Mosque imam Moulana Yusuf Mohammed said its volume had already been decreased after a complaint several years ago. The Muslim Judicial Council’s second deputy president, Shaykh Riad Fataar, said: “We are not sure if the letter that Moulana Muhammad received last week is a new complaint or an older one. “We have confirmed a meeting with the City of Cape Town and the mosque committee for next week Tuesday to try and resolve the issue immediately.” Mayoral committee member for Area South Zahid Badroodien said the notice was aimed at getting the mosque to work with the City to find a solution. “A meeting will take place between the imam of the mosque and the environmental health officials who will discuss various options to address the concerns raised by the community. “A noise abatement notice was issued on December 4, and the aim is not to instruct the mosque to end the call to prayer. "The aim is to work with the city to find an amicable solution to address the complaints raised by either lowering the volume or engaging an acoustic engineer to develop potential solutions.” Shaykh Fataar said the Muslim community was grateful for the Bay View Community Policing Forum and a church that were supporting the mosque’s right of broadcasting the adhan via loudspeakers. “Capetonians are unique in that we co-exist in peace and harmony with our neighbours of various cultures and faiths. “We are extremely grateful for the community’s support in this matter, but ask the community not to take any action before our scheduled meeting on Tuesday.”
