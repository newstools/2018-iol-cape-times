The power utility said this was due to a further shortage of generation as a result of units that have not returned to service as expected. “Generation plant continues to be out on planned maintenance (approximately 5 000MW) and there is a higher than expected number of units (currently at approximately 10 000MW) on unplanned maintenance due to technical faults. “Cahora Bassa hydropower plant is still supplying 700MW less to the grid as a result of a damaged transmission line which occurred late on Wednesday. "Over and above these challenges, we are experiencing low diesel reserves due to the continued pressure on the national grid resulting in excessive usage of open-cycle gas turbines. "In addition, the need to build emergency water and diesel resources to limit the load shedding possibility or magnitude thereof in the following week also remains,” Eskom said in a statement. Stage 2 called for 2 000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period, added Eskom and that load shedding was conducted as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. “We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Eskom would like to sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and uncertainty caused by this.” Meanwhile the City yesterday advised residents to switch off energy-hungry appliances to reduce the impact of load shedding. It said Stage 2 load shedding was avoided in City supply areas on Saturday because customers reduced the demand on the network. Cape Times
