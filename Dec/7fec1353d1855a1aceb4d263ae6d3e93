Police Minister Bheki Cele, along with national police commissioner Khehla John Sitole and provincial police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula will launch the Western Cape Safer Festive Season Plan and officially open the new police station in Samora Machel in the Nyanga Cluster. “The new facility will alleviate caseloads from Nyanga police station which is currently the murder capital of the country. Additional personnel and vehicles have been allocated to Samora Machel to serve the community,” said police spokesperson Novela Potelwa. Nyanga Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Martin Makasi said: “We welcome this new police station. It will save the community time and money in terms of travelling long distances to get service from Saps. It is long overdue. “The community has been asking for this station for over 20 years and they have been patiently waiting. They didn't embark on uncivilised action.” Makasi said the station operated with about 120 members, including 10 detectives of its own, its own head of detectives, head of visible policing and own station commander and support staff. “While the current station is fully operational, the structure is temporary. Plans for Saps to start building are at an advanced stage.By 2021 the building will be complete.” The Western Cape Department of Health donated the land to Saps. The Samora police station was a good example of what could be achieved through an integrated approach where the community and government worked together. Makasi said the biggest problem area was Philippi Brown’s Farm. “This is the hub of crime in the Nyanga cluster. We are talking to the minister to turn the satellite station in Philippi into a fully-fledged station to squeeze crime. "We want criminals to feel the pinch. They will have nowhere to run. Time is up for criminals.”
