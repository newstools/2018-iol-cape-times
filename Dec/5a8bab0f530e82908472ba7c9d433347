Jacobs expressed his outrage after a farmworker was killed when seven men allegedly robbed a farm in Philippi. One of the alleged attackers also died in the weekend attack, while two others were arrested in follow-up operations. Last week an elderly farmer and his wife were murdered in their home on their Bonnievale farm. “We want to thank police for their swift action and call on them to intensify intelligence operations against those behind this," he said. "We call on our courts to impose the most severe sentences on those found guilty of attacking farms.” Jacobs also urged farmers to stop evictions and human rights abuses, and exhorted them to create an environment for peace and productivity in rural communities.
