Cape Town – Luke Skywalker appeared in the Cape Town Regional Court on Monday on charges of attempted murder and kidnapping. A director of the Shaolin Kung Fu Institute of South Africa, the State alleges he attempted to kill Patricia Skywalker by "repeatedly slapping, punching, strangling and hitting" her with his fists on December 29 and 30 last year, News24 reported. The 45-year-old Skywalker, who is out on R500 bail, is also accused of holding her against her will at their West Beach home on those days. Netwerk24 reported Skywalker changed his name many years ago. It also reported that the couple finalised their divorce around two weeks ago. The trial was supposed to start on Monday but defence lawyer William Booth indicated he had important documentation to hand over which he and the State would need to discuss before the trial started. These included documents, photographs and recordings. He told Magistrate Wilma van der Merwe this was clearly a case of domestic violence. He said his client had also opened a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm against Patricia. It is understood the State first wants to see what happens with the attempted murder case before it investigates the assault case. The case was postponed by agreement until February 1 to allow the parties time to consult.
