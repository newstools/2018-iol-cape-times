Cape Town – Earlier this year, the popular World of Birds Wildlife Sanctuary and Monkey Park in Hout Bay had to embark on a critical fund-raising initiative to keep its doors open. Now the 81-year-old owner of the wildlife sanctuary, Walter Mangold, has had to endure another setback and is still in shock following a robbery at the weekend. According to Mangold, two robbers had tied him up and fled with about R70 000 in cash, the SABC reported. He said it had been the best takings in a long time. Mangold said the suspects paid at the gate as regular visitors. He believes it was an inside job as the robbers seemed to have detailed information about his office. “Two people sneaked up, came to the door, saw me sitting there and within a second they were around me and put my head into an armlock. I couldn't breathe, I almost died there. "They asked for the key, opened every drawer on my desk here to find the keys, but couldn't find it. Then one of them put a hand in my pocket and there they found the key to the door and to the safe.” The avian influenza disease was cited as the major reason for selling a portion of the property as the sanctuary needed at least R1 million to carry on with its services through the next season. The sanctuary is a privately run wildlife park that provides sanctuary for 2 000 injured birds and small mammals. Mangold told CapeTalk the sanctuary owes the bank R850 000 and staff have been on short pay for the past five months. He said the sanctuary will beef up security following the incident and conduct polygraph tests on staff to determine potential insider involvement.
