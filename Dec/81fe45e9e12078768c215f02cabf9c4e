Cape Town – Hermanus police say more than 1 500 people gathered outside the local municipality offices on Friday, having marched from Zwelihle and Mount Pleasant. They were peacefully protesting over service delivery in the area, to highlight their grievances to the mayor of the Overstrand municipality and Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, the SABC reported. They are demanding an audit of all the land in the area for service delivery purposes. They are also insisting on municipal manager Coenie Groenewald vacating his position. A spokesperson for the group, Gcobani Ndzongana, told News24 Groenewald and the council should step down because they have been dragging their feet on service delivery, causing unrest that flared up in the area in July. Ndzongana said the knock-on effect of this was that businesses were suffering, putting people's jobs at risk. Police spokesperson Brigadier Donovan Heilbron said community leaders were locked in negotiations with authorities this morning. "They want to hand over a memorandum as well wanting their demands to be met. The protest action is very peaceful this morning. "There were isolated incidents with regards to intimidation, but we as the SAPS have intervened. Eight representatives of the various communities are now sitting with the mayor." Most of the businesses in Hermanus closed their doors ahead of the march. A businessperson, who owns two fast-food outlets, said police were circulating a voice message saying, "Don't be intimidated, it's your life, take control of it". The message was aimed at workers, but no taxis are operating in the town.
