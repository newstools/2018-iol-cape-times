Cape Town â€“ Metro Police officers have arrested three men after a high-speed chase in Rondebosch. Metro police spokesperson Ruth Solomons said on Wednesday the officers were on patrol when they were notified that licence plate recognition cameras detected a bakkie that had been stolen at a school in the area, the SABC reported. The officers spotted the vehicle at the intersection of Main and Belmont roads, she said, but the driver refused to heed instructions to pull over. He sped off and subsequently ended up crashing the vehicle at the corner of Klipper Road and Newlands Avenue. "Officers searched the bakkie and found the following items: Two imitation firearms, housebreaking tools, ATM cards and an identity document, as well as a small quantity of tik, mandrax and dagga. "The suspects, aged 27, 36 and 46 were arrested on a range of charges and detained at the Rondebosch SAPS," Solomons said.
