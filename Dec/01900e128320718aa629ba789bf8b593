This as thousands of motorists were expected to travel on Western Cape roads during the festive season. The department says high traffic volumes at this time of year were expected to cause an increase in moving violations, reckless and negligent driving, speeding, and inconsiderate driver behaviour. “During this time, fatigue is a major contributor to crashes and fatalities. Drivers lose concentration over time, which negatively affects their cognitive abilities and how quickly they can respond to emergencies. "Tired drivers are also more likely to be impatient and take risks. To drive for a long time without a rest is to potentially risk your life and the lives of others. "Motorists are advised to take a 10-minute break outside their vehicles every two hours,” said the department. Fatigue management operations on the N1 will be conducted from a point that is also a safe resting point for any motorist who needs to take a break, said the department. “Using technology as a force multiplier, officers will monitor the length of time that drivers, especially public transport drivers, travel before resting. "This will help to mitigate the risk of fatigued driving. Traffic law enforcement operations will also focus on vehicle fitness and passenger and commuter safety.”Staff Writer
