Cape Town – A 24-year-old man has been arrested after he allegedly blew up an ATM outside a shop in Zwelethemba, Worcester. According to police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk, when officers arrived on the scene early on Tuesday morning, they spotted the suspect fleeing the area, the SABC reported. He was arrested and found to be in possession of stolen cash. The suspect is expected to appear in the Worcester Magistrate's Court once he has been charged. Western Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula has commended the swift police response and hopes the arrest will serve as a deterrent to other criminals. On October 22, SAPS members attached to Worcester Visible Policing and the K9 Unit acted swiftly and arrested two armed ATM robbers, aged 21 and 44 years old respectively, in the early hours. Five other suspects managed to escape after an ATM at Clinic Street in De Doorns East had been bombed.
