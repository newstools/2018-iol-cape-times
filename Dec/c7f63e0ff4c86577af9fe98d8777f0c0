The annual festive season service adjustment kicks in on Monday and will run until January 4. Additional trains have been added on public holidays, including on December 26 and New Year’s Day. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said, unfortunately, the change created an increase in petty crime because criminals capitalised on travellers carrying larger amounts of cash. “To address this, Metrorail Protection Services will increase train and station patrols serving popular holiday spots. Special joint actions to curb contact crimes will also be conducted during the festive season. “Tactical operations will address unlawful commuter conduct, unsafe commuting behaviour and focus on the protection of safety-critical rail infrastructure. Normal weekend services would resume on January 5, and normal weekday services resume on January 7,” Scott said. Tips for safe festive travelling, Metrorail shared, include: avoid travelling with large amounts of cash; keep valuables out of sight; stay in well-lit and protected areas; move to fuller coaches and stay in a group if comfortable in the presence of members of the group; arrange with someone to accompany you from the station to your home if you travel after dark; and take care when wearing earphones as it can reduce awareness of surroundings.
