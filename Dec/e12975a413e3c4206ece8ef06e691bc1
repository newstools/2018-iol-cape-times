Cape Town – A Khayelitsha family is appealing for help in finding their daughter who went missing without a trace several weeks ago. The family of Jennifer Bota, 29, says they are puzzled by her disappearance and are waiting on police to release her photo to the public. Her mother, Nomvusi, 63, says Jennifer lives on her own in Parklands and the family was contacted in November after her friends failed to reach her. “She lives on her own and works at a call centre. On 23 November, we were contacted by her friends saying that her two cellphones were off,” says Nomvusi. “We found it strange and went to her flat where the owner told us that she was last seen getting in a Mercedes Benz, but he didn’t see the registration.” Nomvusi says they reported the matter at Table View he but were waiting on a case number and they submitted her picture for a missing person’s poster. “We went to her workplace where they told us that she was not working there anymore. “She has no children, only a boyfriend who lives in Parow, but he also doesn’t know where she is. “Her friends told us that she is no longer on social media and we are very stressed because we don’t know where she has gone or what has happened to her. She has never gone missing before.” Police did not respond to enquiries. Anyone with information about Jennifer’s whereabouts is asked to call the family on 072 317 3612.
