At a cost of R2.6 million, the centre provides capacity for specialist therapy treatments. About 300 children currently benefit from the special-needs facilities that are aimed at educating hearing impaired and autistic learners. The school had asked the Rotary Club of Newlands to design, obtain funding and construct the building. “Rotarians believe in a philosophy of 'service above self', and through the relationship we have had with Noluthando for the past 13 years, we have been able to plan and deliver this project, as well as other projects that may not have otherwise been available to the pupils who need them,” said Rotarian John Winship. Noluthando School for the Deaf principal Ayanda Alfred Ncinane said: “As a resource centre, one of our duties is to support our neighbouring schools through our outreach programme. "This centre will enable our professional team to extend their services to the surrounding community of Khayelitsha.”
