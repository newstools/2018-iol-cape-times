Johannesburg - South Africans will face yet another day of darkness as Eskom on Tuesday confirmed it has implemented stage 2 rotational load shedding. Load shedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. The power utility announced that load shedding would begin 9am and is expected to end at 10pm and was "a result of shortage of capacity due to a number of generating units still out of service due to a breakdown". "Our maintenance teams continue to work hard to bring the units back to service," Eskom said in a statement. "Customers are reminded to treat all electrical points as live during load shedding.  Eskom would like to sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused." Eskom urged residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during the period of load shedding and switch off geysers and non-essential appliances. This is the fifth consecutive day Eskom has announced load shedding, with the power utility warning that the entire week could be constrained if it was "unable to replenish the diesel and water reserves, and reduce the high unplanned outages".     The entire week could be severely constrained if we are unable to replenish the diesel and water reserves, and reduce the high unplanned outages. Eskom teams are working hard to salvage the situation but the process is going to be hard, long and costly. Visit http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za to view the load shedding schedule.
