Port Elizabeth - President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that the National Minimum Wage will be effective from January 1, 2019, chairperson of the portfolio committee on labour, Lemias Mashile, said on Friday. The National Minimum Wage was passed by both houses of Parliament but while the committee said that it was a "reasonable beginning", a lot more would need to be done so that workers could earn "the desired living wage". "The implementation of the minimum wage is another step in closing the huge inequality that is prevalent in the country. The committee is of the view that the minimum wage will improve the lives of many families that have been earning less and will contribute in stimulating the economy as a result of increased participation by many in the country," Mashile said. The committee has called on employers to implement the minimum wage and for the labour department to ensure adherence to the new law through monitoring mechanisms. "The committee remains of the view that a happy labour market is essential if the country is to grow economically. This is important if the country is to succeed in fighting the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality," Mashile said. African News Agency (ANA)
