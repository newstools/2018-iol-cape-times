Drawing artists from various disciplines and from far and wide, the event will be about so much more than just celebrating the creative form of local artists, according to project spokesperson Christopher Potgieter. “It is a chance to see not only the space where these artists make their magic, but also what drives them to do so in the first place. “All of the local artists, from photographers and sculptors to jewellers and potters, (will) open their studios to the public for viewing and a visit. Imagine being able to not only own a piece of art, but to actually have been able to consult the artist about the creative process,” said Potgieter. He said learning about the reason, the influence and the drive behind the artists’ creation of the artworks was what made owning one a privilege. “It is the opportunity to pay a visit to one of the last surviving centres of the artistic world in South Africa - a village where artists feel at home not only because of the atmosphere, but because of the general ambience that inspires them to create and to thrive,” said Potgieter. The event - from Thursday to Sunday, December 15 to 17 - offers a variety of activities and entertainment including cycling, hiking and running trails, wildlife, restaurants, sightseeing trips, craft shops and angora-based products.
