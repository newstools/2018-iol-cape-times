Cape Town's  – The City of Cape Town commended residents on Monday for keeping their water usage "water-wise" at 541 million litres per day the past week. The average water consumption decreased by 22 million litres per day to 541 million litres per day for the past week, it said in a statement on Monday. This is well within the Level 3 usage range of 650 million litres of collective usage per day. Level 3 recovery restrictions give some relief to residents and business while advocating for continued water-wise usage as it is difficult to predict the rainfall that Cape Town will receive in 2019 and 2020. The level of the dams which supply Cape Town declined by almost 1% over the past week to 69.8 % of storage capacity, compared to dam levels of 34.3% at the same time last year. The average dam level for the province is just over 58%. Western Cape Minister for Environmental Affairs Anton Bredell said the drop in dam levels is as expected for this time of year, the SABC reported. He said the warmer weather and increased demand over the coming months will affect levels even further. He has urged continued responsibility when it comes to water usage over the summer months.
