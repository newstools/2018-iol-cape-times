“It is alleged that at about 8.50am (on Sunday) a farmer and his son were doing maintenance work on the property when 10 men arrived on the pretence of conducting business. "One took out a firearm and threatened the owner, who was forced (to open) a safe and hand over an undisclosed amount of cash. “The owner, his son, and farm employees were forced into a storeroom. One farm worker, 31, was shot in the scuffle and died on his way to hospital. The suspects fled. “Police and farm watch members arrested two suspects aged 33 and 35, and another suspect, also in his thirties, was killed. A car was seized. SAPS forces on the ground have launched a manhunt for the other suspects with help of the air wing." Meanwhile, police had a breakthrough when they arrested a man, 33, for the murder of a couple on a farm in Bonnievale, police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said. “On December 14, Bonnievale police were alerted to an abandoned vehicle along a dirt road. They went to the Sandfontein farm where they discovered the bodies of a couple in their seventies. The victims were hacked with a sharp object. A few items were missing from the home. “On Sunday morning Bonnievale detectives arrested the suspect in McGregor, not far from the murder scene. He was found in possession of one of the couple's missing items. More arrests could be on the cards." ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs lambasted the spate of farm attacks, slamming each assault on the farming community as one against the country, black and white, and also food security.
