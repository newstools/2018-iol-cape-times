Cape Town â€“ Operation Thunder members, the Tactical Response team and the K9 Unit have arrested four suspects in Nyanga for allegedly being involved in random shootings in the area and Mitchells Plain. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said on Thursday two of the suspects were allegedly found in possession of two pistols without serial numbers. According to Rwexana, the third suspect was in possession of an unlicensed firearm and 60 rounds of ammunition. The fourth suspect allegedly had 20 tik straws and 13 mandrax tablets in his possession. The men, aged between 17 and 24, are expected to appear in the Athlone Magistrate's Court once charged. Nyanga, which has the highest murder rate in South Africa, received its second police station on Tuesday, when it was officially opened by Police Minister Bheki Cele. The station will serve the Samora Machel community, following an outcry from its members that population growth and spatial development in the area necessitated the establishment of another police station in the township.
