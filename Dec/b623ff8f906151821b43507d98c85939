Johannesburg - Businessman Johann Rupert set tongues wagging during his interview on Power FM's Chairman's Conversation with station owner Given Mkhari. He was labelled a racist and patronising. Here are some of his most controversial comments: "In Switzerland, I got a letter of 'Thank You' from the taxman, but here they harassed me for eight years. So unlike what your friend with the red beret who thinks I said five years ago that I am 'influential' in SARS, no, no, the opposite." "That's the reason, In a sense, the Afrikaner was downtrodden. The poor white question… but they were driven. They studied like crazy, they saved like crazy. They didn't go and buy BMWs and hang around at Taboo or The Sands (Sandton nightclubs) all the time." "I don't think we'll ever have peace until there is a proper redistribution. I wouldn't say land, I would say property and that we grow the economy. It's not a question of doing it, it's how it's done. Let's not fall into the trap of Zimbabwe and Venezuela. Everything looks good on paper, but the game is played on grass." "I'm toxic. You shangaans have made me toxic, well Vendas, sorry. There's a little Venda with a red beret. You guys have made me toxic." "No tenderpreneurs - a lot of Shangaans are very good at this. Firstly it was the people from the Eastern Cape that must eat then the people from KZN that must eat and now it's the Shangaans.. (and) Vendas." "For very many years our so-called family companies brought back more dividends than the rest of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange put together. These are facts."
