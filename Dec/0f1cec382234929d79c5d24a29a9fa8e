City Traffic Services spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout said the City noted a “circular doing the rounds on social media about roadside arrests for outstanding fines”. “It is concerning that motorists are being misled as it could cause unnecessary problems,” Bezuidenhout said. She said motorists would be arrested only if a warrant had been generated for the outstanding fines. “Officers do not need to have the original fine on hand, as a copy of the warrant suffices. “There is no onus on the arresting officer to present proof that the motorist received a summons,” Bezuidenhout said. In recent months, the City has started generating regular SMS reminders to motorists about outstanding fines. A service provider has also started sending out summary statements of fines so that motorists know what they are liable for, she said. “Earlier this year the City also introduced the online payment of warrants to save motorists a trip to court. We urge motorists to work with us and check regularly whether they have any outstanding fines or warrants,” she said. “It is worth reminding everyone that contrary to popular belief the City’s enforcement efforts are not designed to generate income, but to hold motorists accountable for their actions,” Bezuidenhout said. Motorists wishing to check their fines or status of any warrants can contact the City or register on www.paycity.co.za, where they can view fines and make payments.
