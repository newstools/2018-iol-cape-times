SANParks announced the death of Sandra Davidson, wife of employee Hendrik Davidson. Her body was badly burnt during a fire which gutted three of the 13 houses in the Beervlei SANParks staff village. Eight people, including a pregnant woman, died in Farleigh (Rooikraal) on October 29. They were Elsabe Florina Windvogel, Lesley Andra Bewee and six children: Eljade Jaylene Windvogel, Ethan Calin-Lee Windvogel, Aliyah Simone Sime-Leandre Oelf, Nalaya Nashay Oelf, Niah Na-Lee Oelf and Nalani Brienne Oelf, who was pregnant. Davidson was transferred from the George Hospital to Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town to receive further emergency care. Garden Route National Park manager Paddy Gordon said: “We are saddened at losing Sandra; our thoughts and prayers are with the Davidson family during this trying time. “Our team will continue to provide the necessary support to the family and all affected people.” The Garden Route was rocked by rapidly spreading fires in October that saw hundreds evacuated. The Garden Route District Municipality said the fires left damage four times the size of last year's Garden Route fires, which burnt an area of 22000 hectares. SANParks has thanked Pine Lake Marina for offering discounted interim accommodation to the affected families including SANParks staff, pensioners and private residents. The costs were absorbed by SANParks through its insurance company.
