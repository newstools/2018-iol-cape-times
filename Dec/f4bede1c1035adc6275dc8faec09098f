Cape Town – Two people have appeared briefly in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court for their alleged involvement in creating fraudulent documents to acquire two luxury cars. Edwards Abdusamad, 45, and Enrico Cedric Chambers, 38, were arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Unit on Tuesday. They were allegedly involved in creating fraudulent documents that aided Abdul Karriem Janodien’s alleged fraudulent application for vehicle finance. Janodien, 54, appeared with Corinne Lambert, 47, in the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court. In August, four people appeared in the Vredenburg Magistrate’s Court on charges of fraud and corruption after they were allegedly implicated in the processing of fraudulent vehicle certificates in the Western Cape, the Hawks said. The Hawks said the four people were each released on R5 000 bail, with strict conditions. The Hawks seized two luxury vehicles worth R1.6 million from Lambert, while another two vehicles worth R1.7 million were seized from Janodien. Janodien was released on bail of R10 000 and will appear in court again in January. Abdusamad and Chambers’s case was postponed to January 9 for a bail application. Staff Writer
