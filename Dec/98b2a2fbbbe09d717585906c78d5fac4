Motorists recently visited the Cape Town Civic Centre for the traffic fine roadshow, where fines to the value of more than R1.3 million were paid. Motorists also had the opportunity to plead for leniency by making representations to the prosecutors for a reduced fine, make general enquiries about traffic fines and warrants, and make payments - all at one venue. Mayco member for corporate services Sharon Cottle said the roadshow proved to again be a “resounding success”. “The City has committed to taking services to the residents and we need to walk the talk with such initiatives. “The roadshow is a one-stop shop where motorists can request for a reduction in the amount to be paid for outstanding fines, query their warrants and make payments. “At this time of the year, especially, life gets quite hectic for us all and the convenience of having a basket of services under one roof is a good incentive to get motorists to do the right thing,” Cottle said. The City said the “unprecedented response to the initiative showed there was a need for more such roadshows in the future.” Client Omar Cassim said: “Having all these services in one place is great. I have a warrant of arrest and being at home this holiday, the family will want to go out. “However, the warrant is at the back of my mind. “What if I get pulled over on the roads with my family sitting in the car with me? So I decided to just get it over with.” The City could not confirm how many fines or warrants were cleared.
