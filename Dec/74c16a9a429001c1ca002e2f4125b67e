 MEC for Community Safety Alan Winde believes there is no political will at a national level to curb crime – tantamount to having reached a Day Zero. After the first month in his portfolio, having replaced newly elected Mayor Dan Plato, he said at a media conference on Thursday too many people in the Western Cape are fatal victims of crime, Netwerk24 reported. He is still waiting on Police Minister Bheki Cele to respond to the provincial government's offer to bankroll additional police reservists and to appoint officials to perform administrative duties at police stations. According to Winde, there are too few police officers, not enough police vehicles and the workload of detectives is excessive. "We have reached Day Zero concerning the political will and leadership at national level," Winde said. The MEC said he has had no response from Cele on the requirements and priorities for policing that the province had sent him on October 10. There has also been no indication whether the police is willing to accept the R5 million the Western Cape government offered to pay for additional reservists. "If the minister is serious about clamping down on crime in the province and reducing the workload of officers, he would accept the offer." The province also offered that some of its 84 000 employees volunteer to do certain administrative duties instead of trained police officers. Winde said there is a shortage of 4 500 police officers in the province, with the police contingent in the province dwindling from 22 038 in 2013 to the current 20 969.
