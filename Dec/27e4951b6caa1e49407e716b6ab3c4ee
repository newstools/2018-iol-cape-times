This happened during the hotly contested by-election in Ward 9 in the Witzenberg Municipality, which the ANC won. ANC Witzenberg local election team co-ordinator Clarence Johnson said the matter had also been reported to the Human Rights Commission. “It led to a stand-off between ANC party canvassers who wanted to transport workers to the polling station and the farmer. "Workers have the same statutory rights to be canvassed by political parties, access polling stations to vote and also influence government policies with the expression of their vote. "Farmers who still want to disenfranchise workers by coercing them to vote for the party of the ‘farmers choice’ or preventing workers to cast their vote are committing a crime." The by-election was postponed by the Electoral Court in November following complaints by the ANC and EFF that their supporters were blocked from canvassing. The election was scheduled for December 5 to allow the parties adequate time to access the farms, and the 90-day time frame expired on December 7. Tobie Joubert, general manager of security company Dogs and All said: “I have no knowledge of such an incident taking place, nor have my staff reported any such an incident.” Approached for comment, Dutoit Group managing director Pieter du Toit, through his personal assistant Lien Stemmet, said they would not comment on the matter. Police did not respond before deadline.
