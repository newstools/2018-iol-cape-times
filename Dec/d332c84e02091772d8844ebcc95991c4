Cape Town – The Kensington Community Policing Forum (CPF) has condemned shootings which saw four people wounded at the weekend, saying they will not allow gangs to keep the community hostage. The two incidents happened hours within each other on Saturday, according to police spokesperson Andrè Traut. “Around 00.55am a 30-year-old male and a 27-year-old female were shot and wounded in 6th Avenue, Kensington. "On the same day at 5.40am two male persons, aged 17 and 20, were shot and wounded in Lugmag Avenue. The circumstances surrounding both these cases are being investigated,” he said. Kensington CPF secretary and acting public relations officer Cheslyn Steenberg said: “We call upon the community to report the shooters and where the guns may be. “These bullets flying around have no address and can injure or kill anyone of us. Stop this before we need to pick up a loved one from the streets. “If the gangs think that they can launch their attack on our community, then they are sadly mistaken. We will call upon the Anti-Gang Unit from the SAPS to prioritise the Kensington/Factreton and other units to deal decisively with these gangsters.” Steenberg urged residents to report any suspicious activity. “Residents, with your help we can stop this now before it becomes bigger. We forget that we are entering the festive season. Who wants to live in fear at a time like this?” Anyone with information about the incidents can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 086 001 0111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
