The three men and a woman allegedly killed the 79-year-old man when they tied him up and suffocated him on Saturday evening. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “It is alleged the suspects entered (the victim’s) property in Tijgerhof in Milnerton on Saturday evening. "Police were alerted by neighbours who had heard strange noises. The police’s swift response led to the arrest of the suspects who were still on the premises, and their vehicle was searched.” Knives and a toy firearm were found and confiscated, Van Wyk said. The suspects, two aged 17, another aged 23 and a 30-year-old woman, have since appeared in court on charges of murder and house robbery. Meanwhile, the police are hunting two more suspects involved in a business robbery at N1 City Mall in Goodwood. On Tuesday morning, reports of a store being held up went viral on social media. The police responded, leading to the arrest of a 28-year-old suspect.
