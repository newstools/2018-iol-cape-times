It’s an opportunity she wants to use to maximise her uncapped potential to be a noble and change-making leader, she said. Mngxekeza, 17, from Khayelitsha, attended Herschel Girls’ Senior School where she completed matric this year. She was a speaker in the school’s debating team, which won the 2018 Western Cape Provincial competition. She is preparing to study law at UCT next year. A teacher had suggested that she go with her to Istanbul for next year’s championships, and be an adjudicator and assistant team coach to Saadiyah Mayet. Mngxekeza needed R23 000 to travel and wrote to the Khayelitsha Community Trust to help her with funding. The trust’s chief executive Mkhululi Gaula said it had no choice but to oblige. “We were impressed by Anathi’s objectives and the experiences she wants to bring back and share,” Gaula said. The competition will take place in Istanbul from January 20 to 25, and will also feature educational workshops for debaters, adjudicators as well as coaches. Debaters will have the chance to compete in octo-finals, quarter-finals, semi-finals and the grand finale. Mngxekeza said she looked forward to the opportunity. She had been involved in her school’s debating team for two years. “Even living in a country where the youth especially suffer from issues to do with disease, unemployment, lack of education and poverty, I still see hope beyond that. As long as leaders and diplomats are created out of exactly these young people, we have change is imminent. “We have a wealth of social capital in the youth, it just needs to be tapped into. “By availing myself for such a commitment as participating in an international competition, I’m choosing to make myself a catalyst, an agent for change. “I am hoping this excursion will help me to maximise on my uncapped potential to be a noble and change-making leader, whatever my spheres of influence.”
