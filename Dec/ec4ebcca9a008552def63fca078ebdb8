Cape Town – A 15-year-old girl from Ottery survived an apparent kidnapping after she was grabbed by two men while walking home from the Ottery shopping centre last week. The girl turned up in Sea Point, where she managed to escape and was helped by a jogger who took her to the Sea Point Police Station. The teen had gone to the centre on Monday to meet a friend. She walked home just after noon but noticed a man walking behind her and another one on the other side of the road. “She was then grabbed, her mouth and nose were covered with a cloth and she passed out,” her mother says. She says they reported her daughter missing at Grassy Park SAPS on Monday afternoon. She says her petite daughter, who appears to be younger than she is, woke up in the back seat of a car and listened as the two men spoke to someone on the phone. “My daughter looked at her watch and it was after 4pm. They told the person on the other end they have a pretty 11-year-old and asked what he was willing to pay for her. She struggled and they knocked her out again,” says the upset mom. She says the next time her daughter came to it was in the early hours of Tuesday morning. “She was alone. They were in a parking area.” The girl used her feet to smash the car window and fled. She did not know where she was and ran into the lady who was jogging. “That lady saved my daughter’s life,” the emotional mother says. She says her daughter was not sexually molested. However, she is severely traumatised after her ordeal. She is too afraid to go outside or even talk to people.” All she can remember is that the men drove a white VW Polo hatchback. “She says they were black men who spoke in English and could be foreign,” the mom adds. Police had not commented at the time of publishing. Cape Times
