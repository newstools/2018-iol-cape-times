Cape Town – Christmas came early for children being treated for cancerous tumours at the oncology unit of the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital in Rondebosch yesterday. They were lavished with toys and gifts from Rohan Bloom Foundation Power K8 cycling team members and flooded with refreshments from Vida e Caffè. Foundation founder Rodney Bloom said: “Together with the Vida e Caffè, who kindly sponsored this visit, we are visiting all the kids in the G1 oncology ward just to bring a little bit of joy and happiness over this Christmas season. “Vida e Caffè kindly brought their truck and we’ve given the children, parents and the staff cake and coffee. We’re also telling them good stories and making sure they have something positive happening in their lives. I hope they all have a happy new year and good health for 2019." Bloom said the foundation’s cycling team took part in the Double Century Cycle Race three weeks ago to raise funds. He said they plan to construct a specialised children’s hospice next year that will focus on palliative care for children with cancer. "This initiative is in partnership with Paedspal, a paediatric palliative outpatient care centre. It will be constructed about a kilometre from the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, and the property has already been purchased," he added. The hospice will be dedicated to the memory of his high school sports hero son, Rohan Bloom, Bishops 2017 head boy Christian Rohrer and Jaime Rose Whitesman. All three died from Ewing’s sarcoma – a very rare type of cancerous tumour that grows in the bones or the soft tissue around the bones, such as the cartilage or the nerves. Rohan died in 2016 after battling the illness for two years, while Christian passed away three weeks ago, and Jaime last year at the age of 12.
