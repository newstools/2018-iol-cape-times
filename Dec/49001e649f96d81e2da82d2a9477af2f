JOHANNESBURG - No load shedding will be implemented on Sunday, state-owned power utility Eskom announced on Sunday morning. "We have recovered sufficient pumped storage levels and some of our generating units have returned to service," Eskom said in a statement. However, the power system remained in a state of alert, and should the situation deteriorate significantly, rotational load shedding could not be ruled out. "We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand," Eskom said. African News Agency (ANA)
