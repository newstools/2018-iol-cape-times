Johannesburg - Denel confirmed to MPs on Wednesday it had terminated a R1.1 million bursary agreement with Supra Mahumapelo Jr, the son of the former North West premier. Briefing Parliament's portfolio committee on public enterprises, Denel board audit committee chair Talib Sadik said an investigation into the awarding of the bursary made several findings. This included that the school where Mahumapelo was studying to be a pilot was not an institution approved by Denel, that the pilot bursaries were not advertised in terms of Denel's bursary policy, and that the bursary was granted without following the proper selection process. "As a result of that we have terminated the bursary policy," said Sadik. Denel said it reserved its right to recover any money already paid towards Mahumapelo's studies. African News Agency/ANA
