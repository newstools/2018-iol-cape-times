Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects who fled on foot. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the three suspects entered the Goodwood shopping mall at about 11.10am. “One of the suspects pointed at a cashier with a firearm and took an undisclosed amount of cash and a number of cellphones. The suspects loaded the money and cellphones in two suitcases and fled. "After the alarm was raised, police responded promptly and caught one suspect inside the store,” Van Wyk said. A firearm was confiscated before police pursued the other two suspects, who dropped the two suitcases at one of the entrances to the shopping centre and fled. Van Wyk said no shots were fired and there are no confirmed injuries. Once charged, the suspect will appear in Goodwood Magistrate’s Court on charges of business robbery and possession of a firearm and ammunition. Anyone with information should call CrimeStop at 086 001 0111.
