The first baby born, Zyon, weighed in at 3.28kg and 50cm in length to mom Mishe Jaftha, 21, from Lavender Hill. Baby Zyon was the first of 138 babies born at public health facilities throughout the province on December 25. Proud mom Jaftha said she was in labour for close to four hours after being rushed to Mowbray Maternity Hospital on Christmas Eve. “I was having contractions and some bleeding, but my waters had not broken yet, so the medical staff had to induce my labour. "There was another woman with me, but I was told my Zyon was the first born in the hospital; and then I heard first in the province.” Jaftha said her partner, Bradley Hans, was by her side throughout the labour, and that both mom and healthy baby had been discharged and could not wait to introduce the new born to his older brother, Zaydon. She chose the name Zyon because of its biblical meaning, "holy or spiritual place", and recognising the child as a gift from God. According to the provincial health department, the first three Christmas babies were born in close succession. First Zyon, and then a baby girl born at 12.09am, also at Mowbray Maternity. One minute later, a baby boy was born at Tygerberg Hospital. The first twins were born at 1.30am and 01.40am, and the second set of twins at 2.24pm and 2.27pm. The department congratulated the parents on the safe delivery of all the new arrivals on Christmas Day and extended a sincere thank you to all staff members for their hard work and dedication. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said: “I would like to congratulate all new parents on the birth of their babies on this very special day. We wish them the very best with the new additions to their families. "Remember that the first 1000 days of a child's life is very important. Provide them with a safe environment and good nutrition.”
