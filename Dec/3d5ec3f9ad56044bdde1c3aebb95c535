Former Springbok hooker Naka Drotske is well on the road to recovery and could be going home by Thursday or Friday. That was the good news delivered by his wife Marzanne following the shooting incident in which Drotske was wounded while protecting his family and friends last Thursday night. Drotske, who lives in Bloemfontein, was enjoying dinner with his brother Tinus in Kameeldrift, north of Pretoria, with his friend, legendary Bok prop Os du Randt, when three men attacked. Drotske was reported to have rugby-tackled the intruders to the outside, where he was shot three times. He had an operation on his arm, and was also shot in his abdomen and chest. Now he is set to undergo surgery again on Tuesday. Du Randt was not wounded in the incident. “Dr Van Biljon has just been to see Naka! He is so happy with his progress. His blood pressure is still low, and he will get more blood – otherwise, he is 100 percent!” Marzanne said in a message posted on Du Randt’s Facebook page on Sunday. “Doctor gave him permission to have use his laptop as he feels he wants to keep his brain busy. “His right arm/elbow will be operated on, on Tuesday, and we believe he will be out of the hospital by Thursday/Friday! “Naka is now sitting in his chair and reading a newspaper. It’s like a miracle!”      IOL Sport  Like IOL Sport on Facebook    Follow IOL Sport on Twitter
