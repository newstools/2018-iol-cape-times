Cape Town – The municipality said yesterday the Overstrand fire was still raging along the Afdaksrivier in dense alien vegetation. Overstrand Municipality Fire and Rescue, the Overberg District Municipality Fire and Rescue, a Working on Fire ground team and landowner resources were working on putting out the fires. “A variety of direct and indirect firefighting tactics are being deployed in an effort to contain the fire. “Expect smoke in the area as the dense alien vegetation burns,” the municipality said. Access routes to Hermanus and surrounding areas were open and not affected by the wildfire in Fisherhaven and Karwyderskraal. “The wildfire was pushed towards a chicken farm by a strong north-westerly wind. It burnt through dense alien vegetation and over agricultural lands. With the assistance of WoF aerial support, firefighters managed to prevent damage to infrastructure. “The dense vegetation is hampering the firefighting efforts, which will continue throughout the night. Expect smoke in the area as firefighting operations continue,” it said. By midday yesterday, firefighters had been working on the fires for 24 hours.
