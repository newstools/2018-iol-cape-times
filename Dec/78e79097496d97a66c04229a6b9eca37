These were the words of traumatised Walter Mangold, owner of World of Birds, in Hout Bay, who was tied up before robbers made off with about R70 000. “I am just glad that I am not talking with you from the mortuary today. Things could have been so different. The incident happened shortly after 4pm (on Sunday) when we had done the cash-up for both the cafeteria and the entrance gate. “I went to put the money in the safe, and after locking it up, I sat at my desk. Shortly after, I noticed two men at my door. This must have been an inside job because these guys knew the routine.” Mangold said the perpetrators had already arrived at World of Birds earlier that afternoon and had paid an entrance fee, then proceeded to act like tourists. “When they entered the office, they threw me off the chair while holding me in an arm lock with my face to the concrete floor. “They then searched my drawers for keys and then searched me for the safe keys. They found the keys on me and made off with the money,” he said. Mangold, who said World of Birds was struggling financially, had enjoyed its “first good weekend in six months” after a lot more visitors visited the park at the weekend. Mangold, left tied up with telephone cords, called for help and a group of tourists heard him shouting. “We will now have to do a complete upgrade on security to avoid a repeat of this incident. We urge anybody to help with donations through our crowdfunding campaign running on BackaBuddy.” Police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said they were investigating a case of business robbery. “Two men entered the premises. They demanded the keys to the safe and then tied up the owner. The suspects fled the scene with cash. No arrests have been made,” he said.
