Rizaam “Zaampie” Jacobs, 41, was one of two men shot dead in a drive-by shooting outside Barron’s Estate where they hosted the Mitchells Plain School of Skills’ farewell dance on Friday. In a video doing the rounds on social media, a group of people can be seen approaching the vehicle with bullet-riddled windows, minutes after shots were fired in Knole Road. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said crime experts combed the scene shortly after the men were shot while driving a blue Volkswagen vehicle. “It is alleged that the victim came to the event to drop off an unknown learner. As they left the venue, they were shot at by an unknown man,” Van Wyk said. Both men died on the scene, said Van Wyk. “Detectives are investigating all possibilities. Currently the motive is the subject of the police investigation,” Van Wyk said. Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said counselling and support have been made available to staff and pupils at the school. “The Mitchells Plain School of Skills hosted their fourth-year farewell ball at Barron’s Estate. “While the learners were arriving at the ball, there was a drive-by shooting. The driver and his passenger in one of the cars were reportedly fatally wounded in the shooting. “None of the learners and staff were injured but they are extremely traumatised. “What was meant to be a celebration for the learners was marred by this violent and senseless incident,” Hammond said. Hammond said the owners of Barron’s Estate doubled security immediately after the incident so the farewell ball could continue. Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum cluster chairperson Lucinda Evans has condemned the incident. “It’s of great concern that this incident happened where children were having a festivity. I am grateful none of the children got injured,” Evans said. Anyone with information about the shooting can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 086 001 0111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
