The programme was launched in Athlone in 2014 with 17 drivers. Today more than 800 drivers take part in the programme and transport more than 10 000 pupils daily in Cape Town. The drivers were awarded with cash prizes for exemplary driving every three months. At the end of the year, the safest drivers receive a grand prize. Kay Jaffer, project co-ordinator for the Safe Travel to School programme, said: “ChildSafe research shows that scholar transport drivers on the programme drive more safely than the average driver. “Since the launch of the programme, no fatal incidents involving scholar transport, among the programme’s drivers, have been recorded.” Drivers None Jikwana from Nyanga and Felix Phahlane from Gugulethu scooped a new seven-seater Nissan vehicle. Driver Tsholosholo Benjamin Khantsi from Gugulethu, who was the first runner-up, won R20000, a petrol voucher and a trophy. Second runner-up was Anthea Smith from Kraaifontein, who won R15 000, a petrol voucher and a trophy, while Sam Msadu from Gugulethu was the third runner-up, winning R10 000, a petrol voucher and a trophy. Branmal Swartz, former principal of Norma Road Primary School, where the programme was first launched in 2014, said the drivers were true South African heroes. ChildSafe SA Board chairperson professor Sebastian van As said: “Thousands of children are killed on our roads every year and in most cases it is because of driver error. “By growing awareness and driving more safely, we create a safer community for everyone.”
