This followed a meeting between the Muslim Judicial Council and representatives of the city’s Social Services Directorate Environmental Health Department on Tuesday. The Masjidus-Salihee mosque in Bayview was issued with a “noise disturbance” notice after a resident had complained. At the meeting, it was agreed that the health department would assist the mosque in concluding a noise management plan. MJC second deputy president Shaykh Riad Fataar said: “The department explained the letter sent last week was to notify the imam they wanted written submission of the noise management plan.” Mayor committee member for Area South Zahid Badroodien said: “It was also emphasised during the meeting that the intent of the notice was never to stop the call for prayer, but to lessen the sound level.” Cape Times
