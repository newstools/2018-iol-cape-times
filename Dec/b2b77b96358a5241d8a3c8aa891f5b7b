The council will evaluate how health-care systems should be adapted by 2050 to account for developments in medical research. As the only representative from the African continent, Ataguba will be tasked with furthering the agenda for African countries as well as for the entire developing world. “Africa is rarely in the focus of innovative healthcare initiatives and that there is an under-representation of African voices in the global discourse of development,” he said. Ataguba’s area of research is health economics, which deals with the allocation of scarce resources that have multiple uses in the healthcare system. He said that the Global Future Council signifies that many key players were invested in the development of this non-traditional field of research which will encourage contributions from other health economists. One of the key mandates on Ataguba’s agenda is to advance the role of technology in health economics. “There are many advances in technology that will benefit South Africa and indeed Africa at large. While South Africa has made tremendous progress in advancing science and medicine in Africa and globally, it could still take advantage of new technologies.” He believes that technology can play an integral role in eliminating inequality in the healthcare system. “These technologies should be used to bridge the divides between the rich and the poor in society.” Ataguba said that further investment was required to fully develop the field of health economics in South Africa. “At the moment, the country lacks sufficient number of trained health economists to occupy critical positions, both in the public and private sectors,” he said. He hoped that his selection would further cement UCT’s reputation as a global leader in research and that his participation would show that Africa was as capable as other continents to contribute to the global discourse on the future of health care.
