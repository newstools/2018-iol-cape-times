The fires, which broke out on Tuesday, were subdued late yesterday after an estimated 9 000 hectares of vegetation was destroyed. Cape Winelands Fire and Rescue spokesperson Heinrich Louw said ground crews would remain in the fire-hit areas to prevent flare-ups. “The focused efforts of the ground crews, with vehicle and aerial support, managed to contain the fires in the Cape Winelands District Municipality area. “As expected, the increase in temperatures caused the active fire lines to flare up. Three choppers were deployed to suppress the fire line from the top of a mountain down to the agricultural land at the bottom of the mountain. The fire remains on the western side of the Stormsvlei Road (R317),” he said. According to Louw, two Working on Fire teams and aerial support were provided for the southern side of the mountain in the Overberg District Municipality. “A sudden rain shower on the active 5km (fire) line also assisted us to make progress. This line cannot be considered safe yet until a complete mop-up has been done. Alternative plans will be put in place if the line flares up,” he said. Meanwhile, in St Francis Bay in Kouga Municipality in the Eastern Cape, about 20 houses have been damaged by runaway fires. Authorities appealed to the public to stay away from the houses as they were structurally unsafe and could collapse. One man was hospitalised after suffering serious carbon monoxide poisoning. The fire broke out between Harbour Road and Assissi Drive on Tuesday afternoon, and residents and animals were evacuated from the area as authorities scrambled to contain the blaze. Station commander of the National Sea Rescue Institute at St Francis Bay Sara Jane Smith said an NSRI crew helped to subdue fires at a number of homes in St Francis Bay Village. She said at least 20 houses were affected, but the final number had not been confirmed after strong winds fanned the fire across thatch-roofed houses and dry vegetation in the surrounding area.
