About R13.8 million was spent on the new minibus-taxi facility for Masiphumelele commuters. The project started in May. Mayoral committee member for transport and urban development Felicity Purchase said: “I drive past this site almost every day and have been keeping an eye on the progress. “I’m pleased to say that the contractor is on track to complete the new facility by the end of February next year. “This is good news as we are heading into the builders’ holiday period, meaning about 3 300 commuters from Masiphumelele will be using this brand-new facility next year,” Purchase said. About 60 minibus-taxis will operate from the facility, which will serve commuters travelling to and from Simon’s Town, Fish Hoek, Noordhoek, and Kommetjie. Now minibus-taxi operators operate from a vacant piece of land with no services or facilities for commuters and operators. Purchase said residents were exposed to the elements while waiting for taxis and there are no ablution facilities or safe walkways.
