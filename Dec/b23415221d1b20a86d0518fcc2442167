The 22-year-old was informed of the NPA’s decision on Friday. Her spokesperson, Gavin Prins, said: “Wynand opened a case with SAPS in January 2016, accusing Fransman of sexual assault while the ANC was holding its celebrations in the North West. "A few months later, the ANC’s National Disciplinary Committee announced it had found him guilty on two counts of misconduct, and suspended his ANC membership for five years. “Louisa is relieved that the NPA decided to prosecute. She has always had faith in the NPA and will continue to support the police with their investigation. "Hopefully this case can be finalised soon so that she can continue with her life. More information regarding the next steps have not yet been made available to us.” Fransman could not be reached for comment yesterday. ANC provincial spokesperson Dennis Cruywagen said: “The ANC has conducted its own investigation into the allegations made against Marius Fransman. His membership was suspended for five years. "We have seen reports that the NPA plans to institute charges against him. It’s our view that the law must follow its course. We want to stress that we are committed to achieving a non-racial, non-sexist society.”
