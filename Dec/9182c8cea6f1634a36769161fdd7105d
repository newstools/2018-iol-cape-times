The suspension of the airline’s air operator certificates (AOCs) became effective on Thursday when the airline was notified of Sacaa’s decision. The aviation authority's audit team has also recommended to the director of Civil Aviation to revoke CemAir’s AOCs. The affected AOCs relate to the operator’s permits issued under Part 121 and Part 135 of the Civil Aviation Regulations. CemAir had until on Thursday to provide Sacaa with valid reasons why the certificate should not be revoked. The airline allegedly contravened the Civil Aviation Act, and five other Sacaa regulations, according to Sacaa inspectors following a permit renewal audit. The Joburg-based airline, operating flights between Cape Town and Plettenberg Bay as well as Cape Town and Hoedspruit, according to Sacaa, could neither produce nor demonstrate the appointment of an approved and qualified person for a critical position as required by the Civil Aviation Regulations. On Thursday, Sacaa said its decision followed a thorough review of CemAir’s corrective action plan (CAP), which sought to address the initial findings unveiled during the annual renewal audit, conducted this week. “The CAP or proposed remedial actions by CemAir were found to be unsatisfactory and did not adequately address the findings that were initially raised. “In addition, records in the Sacaa’s possession demonstrated that CemAir has been operating some aircraft outside of permissible loading (weight and balance) limits; meaning the weights of passengers and baggage declared by the flight crew were not the same with those recorded by the service provider contracted by CemAir,” said Sacaa. CemAir knowingly continued to fly their aircraft in contravention of the applicable regulatory prescripts despite being issued with a prohibition order, said Sacaa. “This constitutes a material contravention that threatens aviation safety ... This conduct is absolutely unacceptable and intolerable.” CemAir did not respond by deadline. Cape Times
