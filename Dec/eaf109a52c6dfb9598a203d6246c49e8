Ramaphosa delivered the keynote address at a celebration held at the Walter Sisulu University Stadium in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape on Sunday. Ramaphosa said improving education was at the top of government’s list. Ramaphosa said the country needed to pursue an inclusive economy by improving the skills of young people. “With greater effort we need to improve the skills of our young people. We are continuing to invest significantly in vocational training and working to ensure students from poor families can access higher education.” This year’s commemoration marked the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela and Struggle stalwart mama Albertina Sisulu, who fought to advance human rights, unity and racial and gender equality in South Africa. The celebration was also a rallying point for the #I AM THE FLAG campaign launched earlier this month by Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa to encourage South Africans to embrace the national flag as an element of reconciliation. It is also understood that 20 years after the final Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report, the government is considering reopening the lists for victims who have not shared their apartheid-era abuses, while politicians have called for the prosecution of those who did not come clean with apartheid-era atrocities. In addition, the National Prosecuting Authority under new head Shamila Batohi has been urged by MPs to prosecute those who did not appear before the commission and those not granted amnesty by the TRC. As South Africa celebrates the Day of Reconciliation, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha said he was ramping up efforts to implement the recommendations of the TRC, as part of the government’s national healing vision.
