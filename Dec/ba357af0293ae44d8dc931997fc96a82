You and a loved one can raise your glasses and say cheers to 2018 at Kirstenbosch Summer Sunset Concerts with Loops and Crimson House on New Year’s Eve. The Cape Times is giving away five sets of double tickets to the value of R425, plus a Moyo Kirstenbosch Restaurant voucher worth R300. Jeremy Loops, a musician and the co-founder of tree-planting organisation Greenpop, will usher in the new year with his modern folk hits. Loops entered the music scene in 2011 with the release of his self-­titled debut EP. He has since released two albums, Trading Change in 2014 and Critical as Water this year, which spawned the hit single Waves, and a tour across four continents. Loops said: “My New Year’s message to anyone in our community would be to invest in themselves and their dreams and their hopes.” Crimson House will be opening the evening with their much-loved high energy live performance and heady mix of Gypsy, Swing, Rock ‘n’ Roll with Blues undertones. The band’s electrifying performances are made possible by members Riaan Smit (vocal/guitar/ harmonica), Tim Welsh (alto sax), Gareth Harvey (baritone sax), Arno Van Zyl (banjo), Christoph de Chavonnes Vrugt (drums) and André “Skywalker” van der Merwe (bass). They formed in 2010 and have since released three albums, with a collection of hits including their latest hit singles Take a Chance, ‘on’t Forget to Take Your Medicine, Joes Bounce and Pot of Gold off their upcoming fourth album. Make sure to pack your picnic blankets, treats and champagne to see in the New Year. Gates open at 7pm and the concert is from 8.30pm to 12.15am.
