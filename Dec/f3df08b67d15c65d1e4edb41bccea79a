Allegations that a private company had told beachgoers to leave at about 8pm, or sunset, is being investigated by the City. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs said he and his family were out on Sunday night when two security guards approached them at 8pm, informing them that the beach was about to close and they needed to leave. Jacobs said: “We wonder if this would have been just another unreported incident if we were not there. How many others have been ordered to get off beaches that under apartheid were reserved for whites? "I was out with my family and friends when (they) tried to run us off the beach. There was no political agenda. Our only agenda was to relax and have fun.”
