De Lille said she had a meeting with the leaders of Gauteng, the North West and the Eastern Cape about the way forward. This weekend De Lille’s trusted confidantes Rodney Lentit and former Cape Town council chief whip Shaun August were in the Northern Cape. “We are in the process of building structures in the provinces to ensure that everything is ready for the January launch. The party’s position on several issues has been released on social media,” De Lille said. “The party’s manifesto is being written and other party documents. We are also setting up the offices and other administrations.” On land expropriation without compensation, De Lille said they do not support the concept. “We don’t support it because we believe that the Constitution makes provision for land expropriation already. We believe that should land be compensated, a fair and equitable payment should be given,” she added. De Lille, who resigned as Cape Town mayor and DA member following months of bitter infighting between her, members of her mayoral committee, and leaders of the DA, said she had no personal scores to settle with the DA. jason.felix@inl.co.za Cape Argus
