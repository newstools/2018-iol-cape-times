Johannesburg - Stage one rotational load shedding was implemented from 9am on Saturday morning and is likely to continue until 10pm, state-owned power utility Eskom said. "Customers are reminded to treat all electrical points as live during load shedding," it said in a statement. Stage one called for 1000MW to be rotationally shed nationally at a given period. Load shedding was conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout, Eskom said. "We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electrical appliances to assist in reducing demand." For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact the Eskom customer contact centre at 0860-037-566.
