With non-profit company Brave Heart, Boehme and co-director Pieter Truter are both working to prevent bullying in schools and in the workplace by providing support and guidance to all those impacted by the phenomenon. “I always teach my children to leave a legacy, and if they can help a bully, what better legacy is there?” Boehme said. The duo said they had partnered with the provincial Education Department to host a roadshow at 110 schools next year, during which they would teach children to be loving, and provide counsel and help to those who had fallen victim to a bully. “We are blessed and proud to be able to do what do. We are creating a #BRAVE nation,” Boehme said. Truter, a hockey coach, said he was conscientised to the reality that there was bullying happening within his team. “It’s important for me now to make sure teachers are able to identify signs that someone is being bullied, and in that way, help,” Truter said. Boehme had sold her business in order to make a success of Brave Heart, and said they planned to establish a “one-stop shop” for all those affected by bullying.
