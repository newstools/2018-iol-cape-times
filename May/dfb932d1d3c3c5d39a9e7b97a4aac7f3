The bodies of Rosalie Bloch, 84, and Aubrey Jackson, 96, had been tied up when they were discovered by a family member early on Saturday morning. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said provincial detectives were probing a case of murder and house robbery. “A report suggests the pair, were found dead by a relative who went to fetch them. The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation, with no arrest as yet,” said Rwexana. Graeme Bloch is married to fellow anti-apartheid activist Cheryl Carolus. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs said plans for a memorial service will be announced this week. He said  the ANC condemned the “heinous act” and crime must be combated whether in affluent areas or within townships. “Our branch within the area will later this week announce the details for a memorial for the parents of our comrade,” said Jacobs. The SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) expressed shock at the murder of the couple. It said much more still needed to be done to protect the aged against violent crime. “We condemn in the strongest terms possible the ghastly act and convey our condolences to Professor Graeme Bloch, his wife, anti-apartheid activist Cheryl Carolus, and the Bloch family and their relatives who have lost their loved ones in such a gruesome manner in the sanctuary of their home,” said Sanco national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu. DA provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said: “The DA was saddened to learn of the cruel manner in which Graeme found his parents and wishes to convey its deepest sympathies to the family of Rosalie Bloch and Aubrey Jackson. “We call on the SAPS to act swiftly to locate the perpetrators of this crime.” Attempts to reach the Bloch family for comment were unsuccessful yesterday.
