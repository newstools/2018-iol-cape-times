The City said it marked an increase of 14 million litres on last week’s average, which was a record low of 505 million litres, but was offset by a smaller decline in dam levels. “Water inflow into the dams has largely balanced water usage. ‘‘Dam levels have declined very slightly and remain at 20.9%,” said  Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson. The City believed that residents upped their water usage - which is not supposed to exceed 50 litres per person a day - because of warm, sunny weather. “Water consumption often fluctuates from day to day and this rise could therefore also be considered a normal change in usage. “We will continue to monitor water usage closely. It remains imperative that we all continue our saving efforts to get to the required target of 450 million litres per day,” said Neilson. “It is important that our superhuman efforts to save water continue whether it is hot or cold. “Outside weather conditions should have no bearing on our water usage. “As a City, we are confident that our consumers will help us to stretch the available water in our dams as we move towards an uncertain winter period where we simply do not know how much rain we will receive and whether it will be sufficient to carry us through to summer in 2019.” Meanwhile, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell has welcomed the announcement by Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti that the project to raise the
Clanwilliam Dam wall will resume shortly. This followed a visit to the dam by Nkwinti and Bredell at the weekend. Bredell said the national government planned to raise the dam wall by 13m and that construction would continue soon. The average dam level in the province has remained stagnant over the past seven days following last week’s slight increase. The average level for dams across the Western Cape for the week starting May 7 is 16.53%.
