This follows a report by the Cape Times that the City had informed the members of its intention to withdraw from the programme, designed to work directly with high-risk individuals 
in an attempt to reduce 
gang-related violence on the Cape Flats. The programme, which was introduced through the mayoral urban regeneration programme (MURP) and budgeted for by the City, was discontinued at the end of September last year due to the contract expiring. During its first year in 2013, the Ceasefire programme enrolled 130 members; 48 of them were helped with employment. These numbers have grown since the project’s inception. Ceasefire chairperson Craven Engel said he had been contacted to discuss a way forward. “After the article went out, we got so many positive responses from even private companies who wanted to know how they could help. “And when our members read that they plan to reintroduce the programme, they were so happy,” Engel said. Since the programme was discontinued, Engel said the interventions in the community continued. “Our guys are so excited and positive about the programme being reviewed and possibly brought back to the community. They came running to me and asked me if it was true what they were reading. “We understand to bring the programme back will 
be a process that won’t happen overnight, but we 
are positive at the prospect,” he said. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said: “Acting mayor Ian Neilson has informed me that the decision to cancel Ceasefire will be reviewed.”
