"A few incidents of stoning of officials occurred. SAPS retaliated by firing non-lethal rounds. "The area is saturated with officers from SAPS, Law Enforcement, Metro and Traffic. Situation currently under control." The protests erupted a week ago as residents of Parkwood, many of them backyard dwellers, demanded land and houses. African News Agency/ANA
