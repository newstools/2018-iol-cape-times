Conceptualised in 2010, the expo has become the biggest of its kind in Cape Town, allowing for the entire community of Cape Town to understand the concept of halaal, experience the language, food, dress, culture, traditions and lifestyle of the Cape Muslims. There were also exhibitors on display showcasing Ramadaan-related food, fresh produce, exclusive clothing, cosmetics, homeware and jewellery. There was also an interactive cooking theatre demonstrating the flavours of Cape Town and a historic display of Islamic art and calligraphy. Said Rushni Allie, executive committee member of the Cape Town Ramadaan Expo: “Cape Town is a melting pot of diverse cultures and traditions. We believe the Cape Town Ramadaan & Lifestyle Expo presents an opportunity for the bringing together of different denominations and cultures in the Mother City.” Nadiya Shah of Surrey Estate said: “I support the event every year. It’s our pre-Ramadaan preparation, so
I aim to get the specials before the fast begins, because that
is the time the prices usually go up.” Shah said Ramadaan was a very special month. “It is the only month all your sins are forgiven, you do good and set aside evil things. “In terms of food, its our most expensive month because we go all out, and you see that you have all your special dishes on the table. It’s a whole day's preparation.” Faatima Alexander of Strandfontein said she also came for the food specials. “Food is a big part of Ramadaan. What we have, we share with the poor and our neighbours, anyone in our community, so we do a lot of cooking.” She elaborated on the significance of Ramadaan: “You must be humble and sincere. It is about sharing, not only with our Muslim people but with everyone."
