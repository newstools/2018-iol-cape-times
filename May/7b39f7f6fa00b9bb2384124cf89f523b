A section of Prince George Drive in Parkwood was closed to traffic in both directions on Sunday afternoon after violent protests broke out, accompanied by an attempted land invasion in the Parkwood area earlier in the day. Prince George Drive was closed between Hyde Road and De Waal Road after tyres were set alight in the road. Although violent incidents appeared to have ceased by mid-afternoon the situation was still very tense.

It was reported earlier that angry residents took to the streets, demanding land and houses. Parkwood Backyard Dwellers Association chairperson Dominic Booysen said they had protested peacefully on Saturday, but said frustrated residents were "gatvol (fed up)" by the inaction on housing and "have been failed by the Cape Town City and the DA government", which led to Sunday's unrest.
