Nazeem Daniels, 40, known as “Arab”, was shot and killed at the Rosendal taxi rank. Daniels has been remembered as a man who “always gave to his community”. Delft Community Policing  Forum (CPF) chairperson Reggie Maart said: “We are very disturbed by the brutal murder of Daniels. He was one of our community heroes who one could always count on. “Last week he was with me when taxi organisations had to be engaged to quell the violence that escalated over the past month. "He was always focused on bringing peace back for commuters and drivers alike. His priority was the safety of everyone,” Maart said. Family friend Farida Ryklief said they were devastated by his murder. “I live very near the crime scene and was woken by what sounded like eight gunshots. At the time I did not know who had been shot, but when I got there I saw it was Daniels. “This has really hit us hard because he was very involved with the community. It was very unfortunate that his youngest of four children, who was on his way to school, saw the crime. We have arranged for counselling,” Ryklief said. Daniels will be buried today. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the police were investigating the shooting.
