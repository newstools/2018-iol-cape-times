Australia’s reality TV star won the prestigious competition at a glitzy function at Villa Castollini in Knysna on Saturday night. The 26-year-old was chosen from 19 contestants from across the globe after competing in challenges throughout the week. Contestants also helped out with community work before the 10th edition of Mr Gay World ended in the Grand Finale, where the “King” was revealed. Bruno could not have wished for a better 26th birthday present on the day of the finale, as he walked away with wins in several categories. Of the 12 challenge winners announced, Australia won six, including formal wear, personal interview and the social responsibility challenge. “I was overwhelmed and it’s really an honour. For Australia, it gives us visibility and recognition, but it also gives us permission to help the world now. With the title behind me, I’m able to shine a light on different LGBTI issues across the world,” said Bruno.' He was selected as the new face of MichaelGamePlan, a cosmetics range for men. He also won best interview, most photogenic, best formal wear and best social responsibility campaign. New Zealand’s Ricky Devine-White was named first runner-up, scooping several wins during the evening, including the sports challenge, best written test and best swimwear. Second prince was Mr Gay World India, Samarpan Maiti. The Mr Gay World organisation has committed to helping the winner attend Pride and other LGBTQ+ events around the world. Next year the finals will be held in Hong Kong.
