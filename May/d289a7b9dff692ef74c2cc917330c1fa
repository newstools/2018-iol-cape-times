Lamoer and two co-accused, Darius van der Ross and Kolendren Govender, immediately started serving their sentences yesterday after the court ordered them to hand themselves over at Malmesbury Prison. Lamoer, Van der Ross, Govender and businessman Saleem Dawjee were granted R10 000 bail, with conditions, last week after receiving their sentences and ordered to be back in court yesterday. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said a confiscation order (assets seizure), by the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) had been granted against the main accused, Dawjee . “The State was granted the order of R50 000, which must be paid within 30 days after the granting of the order. Lamoer, Van der Ross, and Govender have informed the court that they are not going to contest or oppose the AFU application confiscation order,” Ntabazalila said. An order was granted against Lamoer for R67329.50, against Govender for R24594.44 and against Van der Ross for R3324. 60. Dawjee is opposing the AFU confiscation order. His application was set to be heard yesterday afternoon, but could not be heard due to a shortage of interpreters. The case continues today. Lamoer and tow-truck company owner Dawjee were both handed eight-year prison sentences in the Western Cape High Court last week, of which two years were suspended. They will effectively each spend six years in prison for fraud.
