Johannesburg - The crippling bus drivers strike will continue as employees refuse to accept an increase that is not backdated. Unions representing bus drivers met on Friday to discuss the employers' 9% offer in the first year and 8% in the following year. National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) general secretary Irvin Jim announced that bus drivers accepted the employer's offer but want the increase backdated to April 1. "Workers are resolute that they want the offer backdated to April 1," he said. Jim said the unions were not in a position to announce the end of the strike. Other demands including nightshift allowance and payment of dual drivers will be taken to a task team to be set up.
