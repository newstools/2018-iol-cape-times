Parliament - Soccer hooliganism was a threat to national security, deputy police minister Bongani Mkongi told MPs on Tuesday. Briefing Parliament's portfolio committees on police and sport, Mkongi said it supported a request by Sports and Recreation Minister Thokozile Xasa to President Cyril Ramaphosa for a commission of inquiry into a trend of increasing amounts of violent incidents at soccer matches. "The question of the growing hooliganism in South Africa in terms of soccer and other related sport is a national security threat that we need to deal with because if we leave it...it can grow," Mkongi said.
