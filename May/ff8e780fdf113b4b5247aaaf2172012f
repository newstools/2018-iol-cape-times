Police said several copper wires “had been stripped out of their insulation casing, but could still be identified” as coming from Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa)
infrastructure. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the damage to the infrastructure from where the cables were stripped was 
estimated at R200 000. “The copper stripped from the infrastructure is sold for next to nothing to legal and illegal scrap yards. “The scrap dealers are criminalising themselves when they continue to buy copper without verifying the source from which the cables are obtained,” said Van Wyk. He said the 36-year-old man would appear in court once he had been charged for possession of stolen copper cables and the damage to Prasa
infrastructure. In Parkwood, two suspects, aged 28 and 30, were arrested on charges related to the manufacturing of counterfeit goods. This after police attached to the Grassy Park Crime Prevention Unit followed up on information that counterfeit money was being manufactured at a residence there on Friday. Police found equipment used to manufacture counterfeit money, including copy machines, an FNB swipe machine, toners and laptops.
