She promised to help the family get back on their feet by providing burial assistance, food parcels and paying for DNA tests. Responding to calls for assistance from the family, Shabangu said her department empathises with them and was more than willing to assist. Police were investigating a case of arson and a 21-year-old woman has been taken in for questioning after eight people from the same family, including five children between the ages of two and 14, were killed in the fire. Three of them were adults between the ages of 27 and 60. Four structures were destroyed in the Taiwan informal settlement. Efforts to rescue Nonkululeko, 60, Dumile, 44, Wanda, 28, Sisipho, 14, Abongile, 9, Endinako, 7, Athenkosi, 7, and Mvano, 2 - all trapped inside one of the three shacks destroyed by the fire - were in vain. Some residents were clearing the debris of the devastating fire, while less than a kilometre away sombre-looking family members huddled in a two-room house trying to come to terms with what happened. Family spokesperson Lawrence Bangani detailed how painful it was to watch their possessions go up in flames. He told Shabangu the fire stripped them of everything. “We are desperate for assistance from the government because there will be no burial or funeral arrangement without first conducting the DNA tests,” said Bangani. Shabangu said: “We will look at the DNA issue without you having to pay the R900. “We will help with food parcels. We heard you will be burying in Cofimvaba (Eastern Cape) and we are willing to assist you to go 
there.” Shabangu asked the family and the residents to be calm and not take the law into their own hands against the 21-year-old suspect. Bangani said he was grateful for the help from Shabangu because they need the money to transport their relatives’ remains to the Eastern Cape.
