De Lille, who has condemned the violent protests in the area, said she met the Vrygrond Development Forum twice in the last month. “In one of my meetings with the forum in late April, the City proposed three pieces of land which could be developed for the benefit of the people of Vrygrond, an option which the leadership forum was open to explore,” she said Following that meeting, City officials conducted a site visit on May 10. “As a part of the process, the officials showed the community leaders the three proposed pieces of land which could be developed for the benefit of the people of Vrygrond. "This proposal was rejected by the community leaders,” De Lille said. “I am disturbed by the scenes coming out of Vrygrond, where public and private property has been
damaged in the name of protest. "We cannot tolerate or accept any justification for the destruction of property during protest action.” In Parkwood, community leaders are set to meet Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela following days of violent protests in the area. Yesterday, the City’s rent office and community centre were vandalised when residents gained access to the property and allegedly stole various items, including furniture and computers. Community leader Paul Philips distanced himself and others leaders from the violent and criminal activities. ‘‘We are aware of the vandalism that occurred at the City’s rental office and the community centre between Sunday evening and Monday morning.’’ The DA-run provincial administration has blamed decreasing budgets and the high demand for housing for their failure to deliver an adequate number of "housing opportunities". But the ANC has slammed the provincial government, saying the DA had not prioritised the provision of housing to the poor.
