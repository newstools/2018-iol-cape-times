De Lille replied: “I will walk away. You summed it up correctly. Because really it is not about hanging on to... I'm serving there at the behest of the DA. The DA has gone through a process and Electoral College, they have put me into that position. I’m not representing my jacket, I’m representing the DA and, if the DA feels it wants to put someone else in that position, they are also entitled to do that.” Natasha Mazzone, deputy chair of the DA federal council, then confirmed that a charge was brought against De Lille in terms of Section 3.5.1.2 of the DA’s constitution.
