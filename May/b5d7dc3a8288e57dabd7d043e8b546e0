The school was burgled on Wednesday. The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) reported the alarm system did not trigger during the break-in as its batteries needed to be replaced. Department spokesperson Jessica Shelver said they were concerned about vandals
targeting the primary school and appealed to communities to help prevent vandalism at schools. When the school reopened in January, the WCED reported the school had suffered severe vandalism, with burglar bars and taps stolen, windows broken and toilets damaged. It was later discovered that former pupils were responsible. Ward councillor Jonathan Cupido said he was disappointed that the school was a victim of vandalism and burglary again. “Vandalism to our schools is unacceptable and indeed cowardice towards the innocent children. Children are the future of our communities and education plays a vital role towards a healthy society. “The best news ever could have been that the school was being upgraded; these actions are taking us backwards. I wish to call on the community to protect the resources that we have,” said Cupido. He said the resources were intended to benefit all in the community, and called on residents not to allow such behaviour. “We surely cannot let it disrupt the education system for our young children. If any person has information on the break-ins or the whereabouts of the items stolen, please report it to the SAPS. “I further wish to ask our community not purchase any item from persons who they suspect or who they view as dodgy, but rather report such persons to the SAPS.” To report vandalism or burglary at schools, call the Safe Schools
