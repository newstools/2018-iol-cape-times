The mayoral committee, appointed by the outgoing mayor, was dissolved with immediate effect, which meant that only the Speaker and Neilson were political authorities in the City. “I will apply my mind in the coming days to appoint an interim mayoral committee that will serve until council elects a new executive mayor,” Neilson said. “The city manager has informed the IEC about the council vacancy. ‘‘We await due process to unfold and we will communicate further in due course.” The IEC has noted the court papers served on it by De Lille’s lawyers. According to the commission, it will not be declaring any vacancy for mayor until the matter is resolved in court. Neilson made the announcement hours after the DA revoked De Lille’s party membership. “As acting executive mayor, I hold the authority of the mayoral seat and I am committed to continuing to serve the residents of Cape Town with uninterrupted service delivery. “Having served as the executive deputy mayor for the past nine years, having been a City councillor for 22 years, and having been involved in the leadership of numerous administrations, I am fully informed of the needs of the City and those we serve,” Neilson said. De Lille earlier said Mayco members had already been informed to vacate their offices, which was premature because of her pending legal action. Outgoing Cosatu Western Cape chairperson and former ANC council leader Tony Ehrenreich said the way in which the DA had dealt with De Lille showed the disregard the “old
white elite” have for the black DA leaders and its members. “The old white guard are essentially racist in their orientation and only tolerate blacks in the leadership of the party as long as they listen to DA’s baas. “This should be a clear lesson to those blacks and coloureds who support the DA that the DA elite are intent on maintaining the generational advantages of the white community,” he said.
