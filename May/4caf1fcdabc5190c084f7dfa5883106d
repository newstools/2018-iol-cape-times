The City said a female commuter sustained serious burn injuries, while three others had minor injuries. City Fire and rescue services spokesperson Theo Layne said they responded to the train fire at 9am. While investigation into the matter continued, Layne said probable cause was suspected incendiarism. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said firefighters, who had extinguished blaze, found the body. He said crime scene experts and the fire brigade were on scene, combing the area for clues. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said the train crew uncoupled the burning carriages from rest of the train to contain damage. She said three Metrorail employees were treated for smoke inhalation. The incident came a week after an arson attack was believed to be the motive behind the burning of two Metrorail carriages en route to Simon’s Town on Tuesday last week. Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker wished the injured a speedy recovery. “The damaged carriages will be taken to the depot for further investigation and assessment by Prasa loss adjusters,” Scott said. “Anyone with information or footage of the event is requested to provide this to police. All reports will be investigated and treated in strictest confidence. " Rewards of up to R25 000 are payable for information leading to successful convictions.” Anyone with information can contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or sms Crime Line  32211.
