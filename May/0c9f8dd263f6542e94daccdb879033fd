The Graça Machel Trust will celebrate its founder this month - Africa Month - after receiving the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) highest honour, the Gold Medal Award. She was bestowed the World Prize for Integrated Development by international development organisation Niras. She was presented her award during the World Health Assembly event in Geneva on May 20. WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus said: “I admire many women in global health, and today I had the privilege to present the WHO medal - our highest distinction - to one of them, Graça Machel. "You are a true example for all of us.” Machel was the first black woman to be awarded this accolade, and the second esteemed Laureate after the late Dr Hans Rosling. Upon accepting her award, Machel asked for continued commitment to the realisation of universal health commitments. “We can’t afford to come to 2030 and tell the mothers, babies, children, and adolescents of this era that we have failed." The second award was received for her significant social justice achievements and leadership of the Graça Machel Trust. The trust said: “these two awards draw our attention to the role women are playing towards the realisation of the global development goals". "Through the work of the trust, Mrs Machel has managed to advocate for better conditions for women to access and create wealth through building networks and amplifying the various women already playing important roles in the economic development space.”
