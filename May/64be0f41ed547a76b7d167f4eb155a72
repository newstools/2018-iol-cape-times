Law enforcement tore down and removed 111 illegally built structures along Prince George Drive, said the City’s spokesperson, Wayne Dyason. The structures were destroyed a day after MEC for Human Settlements Bonginkosi Madikizela met residents. Police used rubber bullets, water cannon and stun grenades to disperse crowds. A protester was captured pointing what police at the scene confirmed was a firearm towards officers. “They are just making our situation worse by burning tyres and stoning officials,” said a backyard dweller. An elderly woman, who did not want to be named, said she had put up an 
illegal structure on the field over the weekend as part of the community’s  peaceful 
protests. “On Saturday we protested peacefully and put up structures on the field as part of 
the protest. “I live in overcrowded conditions, much the same like many people in Parkwood. “Families live on top of one another, which is inhumane. “Some of us have been on waiting lists for years but still we do not get homes,” the grandmother said. On Monday morning, the Parkwood rent office and community centre were vandalised when they were set alight. A number of items including computers were stolen. Police spokesperson Wynita Kleinsmith confirmed yesterday that police had recovered a number of stolen items after following up leads from the
community. “We commend the community for coming forward and 
giving information to successfully recover items. “So far, we have made 
three arrests on two dockets of possession of stolen goods,” she said. Cape Times
