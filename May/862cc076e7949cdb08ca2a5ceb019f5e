A woman, believed to be in her forties, was killed and a man and two other women injured when they were "trapped under a rockfall on what is understood to be a path that has been temporarily closed" on Table Mountain in Camps Bay, paramedics said on Sunday. ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene at about midday, where they had to wait for a helicopter to bring the injured man down, ER24 spokesperson Annine Siddall said. He was treated and transported to a nearby hospital for further medical care. The woman was declared dead by mountain rescue services. Two more women, also believed to be in their forties, sustained minor injuries and did not want to be transported to hospital. The exact circumstances surrounding the incident were not yet known, Siddall said. In April,Â a fire raging above Kirstenbosch was started by a massive rockfall which generated enough heat and sparks to set the mountain on fire. African News Agency/ANA
