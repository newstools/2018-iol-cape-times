Abduragman, who advocated for land restitution for families who were forcibly removed from their homes to make way for whites in the 1960s, died of a health complication two weeks ago. His contribution and fighting spirit for the Claremont Land Claimants was hailed at the memorial service on Saturday when family, friends and colleagues gathered to celebrate what they said was a life 
well lived. Long-time friend Neville Hendricks said Abduragman devoted his life to helping people in need not for gain but because of his passion for justice. “He was an inspiration in his community and beyond,” said Hendricks. He said Abduragman did not shy away from publicly disagreeing with politicians and because he was vocal that irritated many people. “He will be missed. He was a very special guy, he was selfless  and sacrificed a lot of his time trying to help others. It irritated him that the democratic state took too long to come to the rescue of those in need. ‘‘It did not sit well with him that many of the families that he fought for died and now their children were continuing with the claims,” said Hendricks. “We will miss him, especially people that interacted with him on a personal level. He had time for others.” When Abduragman became an activist for land restitution claimants “he never did so to gain anything”, according to Hendricks. He said news of the forced removals in the 1960s devastated residents. Abduragman’s efforts and pleas for justice for land restitution was a good example and encouraged and inspired other claimants to submit their stories to the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. Claremont residents formed a committee in 1996 in a bid to come together and submit claims. While a substantial amount of families opted for a financial payout, others including Abduragman, chose the option of land.  sandiso.phaliso@inl.co.za
