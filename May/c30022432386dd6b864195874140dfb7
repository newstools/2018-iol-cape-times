Bloewata Taxi Organisation chairperson Justice Marobela said the organisation’s working committee waited for owners to collect them at the Kraaifontein police station with no conflict or confrontations. “These vehicles are operating on routes they have no permits for and last year an agreement was signed that the Congress for a Democratic Taxi Association (Codeta) and Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association organisations would not operate in the Brackenfell and Cape Gate areas. “However, these taxis have been coming into the area, dishonouring the agreement that was signed last year,” he said. Marobela said he contacted Codeta to ascertain why the vehicles were operating in the area in contravention of their agreement. “Last year, innocent people lost their lives when conflicts reached boiling point regarding illegal route invasion. We do not want a repeat of that. “That is why we did it in this manner today, to show we are willing to work with them if they work within the agreement terms. “We called Codeta’s chairperson numerous times to find out why these taxis are in our area and we were told every time that it was not their vehicles. “That is why we decided to impound the vehicles to have evidence of these taxis operating in the area, asking taxi owners to come forward and claim their vehicles,” Marobela said. “We decided to hand over the vehicles at the police station in front of police and law enforcement officials to avoid any altercations,” he said. The drivers of the impounded vehicles said they were “instructed by the owners to operate in the area”. “We did not know we are not allowed to operate here. “We got instructions from our owners,” they said. Codeta chairperson Pritchard Malgas said their vehicles were not operating in the area illegally. “We are in the process of getting the permits for these vehicles to operate on those routes. They do not have the permits yet. We were told they would be finalised in July,” Malgas said.
