The dance school was forced to make adjustments 
as the drought affected 
the daily operations of the 
ballet school that teaches about 100 pupils three times a week. For nearly 30 years, Zama Dance School has trained young dancers and provided a safe and nurturing learning environment for at-risk children. As soon as FMR heard the school was in dire need of water they came on board to assist in raising funds for a water tank. Just after three days, FMR received a call from Sandy Geffen, from Lew Geffen Sotheby’s International Realty, who donated R30000 in memory of her son. “In essence it is for me a dream come true that I am able to give a ‘gift of life’ of ‘water’ to Zama. I am blessed to be able to give to such a wonderful cause and my heart is grateful especially in the name of my son, Barak Geffen. Thank you to FMR for providing this generous opportunity,” said Geffen. In spite of FMR telling listeners they had reached the target, donations still poured in totalling R52300. The school has decided the remaining funds will be used to purchase water when needed. On Saturday, the school’s director, Andrew Warth, dance teacher Leanne Voysey and the Zama dancers hosted a celebration with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. “We are overwhelmed by the generosity of FMR listeners and an extra big thanks to Sandy Geffen. Thanks to Lawrence Benatar for the water system installation and to Lynda Jennings for photography. “We had to tell students they cannot flush the toilets, they do not have to shower, in a bid to save water, which was confusing for them. Being without water has cut off a limb from the work we do,” said Warth. The school also applauded Zama graduate Thimna Sitokisi, who is a full-time student at the Cape Academy of Performing Arts in Westlake, for his performance choreographed by Daniel Rajna. FMR station manager Mark Jennings said: “It was a wonderful morning, filled with beautiful dance, wonderful people and of course a state-of-the-art water system.”
