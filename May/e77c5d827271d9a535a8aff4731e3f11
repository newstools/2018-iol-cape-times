Politicians, activists, the clergy, civil society organisations and members of the business fraternity attended the gathering hosted by the Muslim Judicial Council. “I am humbled and honoured to be invited today as a guest of the Muslim community for the Ramadaan Iftaar programme. I come here today to say that there has been much progress. Working together, we have achieved a lot in a relatively short space of time. But we are also the first to admit that many challenges remain,” said Ramaphosa. He said it was people like Dr Abdurahman, Cissy Gool, Dullah Omar, Imam Abdullah Haron and Sheikh Nazeem Mohamed who ensured that Muslims were an integral part of the achievement and the construction of a free and democratic South Africa. “They were therefore capable of outstanding contribution and enormous sacrifice in the struggle for a democratic South Africa that is non-racial, non-sexist, non-sectarian, united and prosperous society,” said Ramaphosa. Last night was Ramaphosa’s first-ever iftar programme to share a meal and breaking the fast hosted by the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC). The MJC said it has throughout the years hosted presidents for iftar during Ramadaan, including the late Struggle icon Nelson Mandela. MJC spokesperson Mishka Davies said the dinner aimed to build a stronger relationship between civil society, working in partnership with the government “thus ensuring the social development and economic growth of all South African citizens”. Topics discussed at the dinner included the land issues, safety and security of citizens and the building of sustainable partnerships to address common challenges communities face. MJC president Shaykh Irfaan Abrahams told Ramaphosa Muslim’s marriages were not recognised resulting in their children to be “regarded as illegitimate”. “Even when we die our death certificates reflect ‘not married’,” he said. “Gentrification efforts spearheaded by local government has seen the unilateral increase of rates and taxes.”
