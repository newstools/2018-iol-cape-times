'Wedding Bashers' judge Denise Zimba seemingly threw some light shade at the Miss SA 2018 host Bonang Matheba on Sunday. During the pageant, which was held at Sun Arena in Pretoria, the 'Being Bonang' star asked Denise Zimba who she was excited to see perform during the pageant. READ: Lorna Maseko and Bonang Matheba living it up in France Not missing a beat, Zimba said she's very excited to see DJ Zinhle perform and Matheba, keeping it professional,  then redirected the answer to the audience, asking if they were ready for Zinhle's performance.      In case you missed it, Matheba and DJ Zinhle were friends once upon a time and their friendship came to an end due to allegations that Matheba was having an affair with DJ Zinhle's baby daddy/ex-boyfriend AKA. DJ Zinhle confirmed that the alleged affair happened when she made a blog post about the situation saying that she found out the affair a week before she was due with Kairo. It most likely was an innocent answer, but the Twitterati seems to think that Zimba was throwing some low key shade Matheba's way.
