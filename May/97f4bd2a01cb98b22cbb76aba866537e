Sisters of the Wilderness, directed by filmmaker, Karin Slater, is set in South Africa in the oldest game park in Africa, the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi park, where the white rhino was saved from extinction. The film follows the women as they walk in big game country and camp under the stars. Exposed to the elements and carrying on their backs all they need for the journey, they face emotional and physical challenges, and learn what it takes to survive in the wild. Protected by a pair of rangers and overseen by a motherly guide, they learn about animal behaviour, their Zulu ancestry and the importance of conservation. “We want to ‘transfer’ the audience to an ancient place where no barriers separate human and nature,” said creator/producer, Ronit Shapiro, of One Nature Films. Shapiro’s experience in the iMfolozi wilderness and a meeting with South African conservationist, the late Ian Player, inspired her to make this film. “A journey into wilderness is an intense experience 
where one can expect to undergo a personal transformation 
and build leadership,” Shapiro said. Slater said: “I was born in Empangeni and spent my 
early years, close to the 
iMfolozi wilderness. “I have a deep love and connection to this area. I know what the wilderness has done for me over the years.” The film also explores the plight of this wilderness 
area threatened by an open-cast coal mine on its border, as 
well as the severe poaching that is reducing the rhino population. Shapiro has engaged London-based, Evolutionary Films, as the film’s international sales agency. Screenings at Encounters in Cape Town are on June 2 at the Labia at 3.30pm, June 6 at the V&A Waterfront at 8pm
