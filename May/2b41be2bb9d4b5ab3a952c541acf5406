Lamoer and tow truck company owner Salim Dawjee were both handed eight-year prison sentences in the Western Cape High Court, of which two years were suspended. They will effectively each spend six years in prison for fraud. Lamoer, Dawjee, former police brigadiers Darius van der Ross, Sharon Govender and her husband, Kolin Govender, faced 109 charges of corruption, racketeering and money laundering involving R1.6m. Sharon Govender was acquitted of the charges against her, while Van der Ross will serve a two-year prison sentence. Kolin Govender will serve four years. The four were convicted after they entered into a plea bargain during February. Former Western Cape police commissioner Lamoer was found guilty of corruption, but not guilty of racketeering and money laundering in February. Lamoer pleaded guilty to one of the corruption charges. He previously admitted in court that between December 2011 and September 2013, he took loans from Dawjee with 
the agreement that they would be paid back “on request or 
after my retirement from SAPS”. Allie said Lamoer, Ross and Govender had 80 years of service to the SAPS between them. “It beggars belief that none of them thought receiving financial assistance from (Dawjee) constituted corruption. The court has simply not been told by the accused why they deemed it necessary to accept those gratifications,” she said. The former cops and businessman were found guilty of fraud and corruption in February, while Sharon Govender was acquitted of all the charges she faced. Dawjee’s lawyers indicated in court that they would appeal the matter. However, Judge Allie said they could only appeal after their written judgments had been received. The National Prosecuting Authority welcomed the sentences. Acting head of the Hawks Yolisa Matakata said she hoped they send a strong message to the police and law enforcement organisations that corruption will not be tolerated.
