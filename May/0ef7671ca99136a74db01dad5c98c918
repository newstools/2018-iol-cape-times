Western Cape High Court Judge Daniel Thulare sentenced Jantjies to life imprisonment for the murder, 15 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances, 15 years for possession of an illegal firearm, and five years for illegal possession of ammunition. Judge Thulare ordered the robbery and possession of an illegal firearm convictions run concurrently with the life imprisonment sentence for murder, which means Jantjies has effectively been sentenced to life imprisonment. The State prosecutors, advocates De Jongh and Ronelle Stone, argued for the harshest possible sentence. In February 2016, Koopman, in uniform and driving a marked car, was about to leave home after lunch when Jantjies shot him in the chest in front of his son. “This was a premeditated murder it was cold-blooded, vicious and callous. He was still on duty in a law enforcement car and in execution of his duties. "In addition, the fact that he was robbed of his service pistol is an aggravating circumstance. “The accused did not take the stand. He did not explain to the court what happened, take the court into his confidence or show remorse. "A person who does not show remorse poses a danger to society as he does not see any wrong. It doesn’t look like he will be rehabilitated,” said De Jongh. Eric Ntabazalila said: “The NPA welcomes the sentence and hopes it sends a clear message that the killing of police officers is an attack on the state and those involved will be dealt with harshly." - Staff Writer
