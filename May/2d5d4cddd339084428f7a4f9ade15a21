One person has died and a woman sustained serious burn injuries when a city train caught alight on Wednesday. Cape Town's Fire and Rescue Services said they responded to reports of two carriages on fire on the train between Ottery and Southfield stations just after 9am. Spokesperson Theo Layne said:Â "One adult female sustained serious burns, three adult females minor injuries. All patients were taken to hospital. "On further investigation, Fire and Rescue located one adult, gender unknown, with fatal burns." He said arson was suspected and that the investigation had been handed over to the South African Police Service. Commuters were evacuated and the burning carriages decoupled from the rest of the train to contain the damage. Buses were requested to operate between the Ottery and Wetton stations and the line was temporarily closed, which could last three to four hours.
