The NGO working to safeguard Africa’s vulture population through rescue and rehabilitation, issued this warning after it had recorded the killing or permanent maiming of 23 endemic Cape vultures through electrocution on the country’s power lines during April. Most incidents were recorded in the North West and Eastern Cape. Alarmed by its previous survey highlighting a mortality rate of around three vultures per month and a rise in the electrocutions of the Cape vulture, Vulpro warned that unless urgent preventative action is taken the species would become extinct. Vulpro’s power lines survey recorded 56 vulture deaths through power lines over the past three years, in contrast with 40 recorded from January to December last year. Vulpro founder and manager Kerri Wolter said according to cases which the public, landowners and farmers had reported to Vulpro, it had found 422 vultures (Cape, white-backed and lappet-faced) dead or injured because of power lines. But the figure, in reality, surpassed this, she added. “For our team, the death by electrocution of the oldest of our captive-bred chicks, which was released last year on November 8 to help supplement the wild bird population, hit us particularly hard. “The unsafe electricity grid should be seen as a priority for the survival, in particular, of the endemic Cape vulture. “We have a responsibility, internationally, to safeguard this iconic species.” Cape vultures are classified as globally endangered, with fewer than 4200 breeding pairs left, which put them on a par with the endangered black rhino which has a population of about 5000 breeding pairs left, Wolter said. She said they were slow-breeding, reaching maturity between five and seven years of age and laid only one egg a year. As the only endemic vulture species to southern Africa, they have become extinct as a breeding species in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, Wolter said.
