The announcement, made at the fourth annual Times Higher Education Emerging Economies Summit in Morocco this week, saw UWC ranked in 117th position out of 380 universities. As a previously disadvantaged institution, UWC has made significant strides and is one of the top eight South African universities ranked in the Advanced Emerging Economies. UWC is also among the top 125 universities ranked in the Emerging Economies Ranking. The Emerging Economies Universities are clustered in three categories: Advanced Emerging Economies (including SA), Secondary Emerging Economies and Frontiers Economies. The Emerging Economies University Rankings 2018 considered research-led universities from the 50 countries classified as emerging countries (advanced and secondary) or “frontier economies”. These include countries such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Egypt, Nigeria, Mexico, Argentina and South Africa. The 378 universities on the final list were drawn from only 42 countries because of the rigorous criteria that are applied to the rankings. UWC’s rector and vice-chancellor, Professor Tyrone Pretorius, said he was extremely proud of the achievement. “We have done very well in the World University Rankings previously, and this announcement is further affirmation that we are on the right track in terms of our growth and progress,” Pretorius said.
