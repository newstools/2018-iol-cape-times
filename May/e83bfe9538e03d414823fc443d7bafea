Cape Town - Violent and destructive protests would be avoided if state funds were spent in the service of ordinary South Africans, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) said on Friday. SAHRC's comment comes after Auditor-General, Kimi Makwetu released "The State of Local Government and Financial Management 2017" report, on Wednesday.  The report found that the number of municipalities with clean audits dropped from 48 in the 2015/16 financial year to 33, while there was an increase in the number of municipalities receiving unqualified audit reports, from a 108 to 112. Qualified audit outcomes increased from 60 to 66.

There are more than 250 municipalities in South Africa. African News Agency/ANA
