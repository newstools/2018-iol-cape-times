Suspected car thieves fleeing police in Cape Town drove straight into the grounds of a notorious maximum security prison, police said Monday. A police patrol spotted the car on Sunday as it was being driven in Tokai, after having been reported stolen from the affluent area of Hout Bay. As police gave chase the four "fled into Pollsmoor prison", city police spokesman Wayne Dyason told AFP. The suspects – whom the local media have dubbed the country's "dumbest criminals" – were arrested in the prison grounds. According to a prison official, the men accessed the complex through an entrance that leads to the wardens' residential area, and then abandoned the car before heading off on foot. "They entered through the gate where the officers live, and that is where they were caught," Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said. Pollsmoor Prison holds some of the country's most notorious criminals and gangs. Last year, an average 146 cars or motorcycles were stolen across South Africa each day, according to police figures.
