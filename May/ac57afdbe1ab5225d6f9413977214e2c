Saunders, whose trial commences a year after the body of 3-year-old Courtney Pieters was found, is accused of raping and killing the toddler from Salberau. Yesterday, family and residents gathered at Belhar Cemetery for the unveiling of a tombstone. The gathering was an emotional one for all especially Courtney’s mother, Juanita Pieters, who stood at her child’s gravesite on Mother’s Day. “It still hurts every day to know my child is no longer with us. I miss her every day and all of it still feels like it happened yesterday. “My message to all parents is to please look after your children. I lost my baby a year ago and it still hurts. Always protect your children,” she said. Pieters said her baby daughter’s donated tombstone is “beautiful” but the memories are still raw. “It brings back so many memories. Every day the pain, suffering and longing is still there. I miss her every day of my life,” Juanita said. In preparation for the trial, she said she has “given the case to God”. “To be honest, I have given this case over in prayer to God. I have asked Him to take care of this case for me. We cannot do this on our own because we are only human. At the end of the day, He has the last say,” she said. Bernie Weber, from the Salberau Residents Association Neighbourhood Watch, said residents should continue applying the “Your child is my child” concept.
