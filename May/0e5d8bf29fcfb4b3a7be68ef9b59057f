The much-anticipated trial of alleged rapist and killer Mortimer Saunders, set to begin yesterday, was delayed after the defence indicated they would be disputing one of the charges against their client. He allegedly raped and murdered 3-year-old Courtney Pieters in Elsies River last year. Saunders' defence lawyer, Morné Calitz, requested a postponement to obtain a pathology report. Judge Pearl Mantame granted the request and the trial will resume on May 28. The case against Odwa Nkololo, who has been charged with the rape and murder of 4-year-old Iyapha Yamile, was postponed because there was no interpreter available. Iyapha was last seen on May 1 last year and her body was discovered stuffed in a municipal plastic bag the next day. Nkololo denies he willingly made a confession statement shortly after he was arrested, testifying he made the statement under duress after he was assaulted. The case against Xolani Lantu, 35, charged with the kidnapping, rape and murder of 5-year-old Minentle Lekhatha, was also postponed. Minentle’s mutilated body was found under a bridge about 1km from her grandmother’s house in the Strand. Six local organisations have used Child Protection Month to raise awareness. Drakenstein Child Protection Programme project manager Mariette Jacobs said: “When we hear about the children of our nation and community getting harmed through neglect and different types of abuse, we feel a deep sense of grief. "But there is hope in finding collaborative solutions together.”
