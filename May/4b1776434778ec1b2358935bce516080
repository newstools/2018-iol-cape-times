The 10-year-old, Oyintanda Ndeleni, received a wheelchair and a walking aid from the Mayco member for Central Area, 
Siyabulela Mamkeli. Oyintanda was paralysed at the age of two. When she sneezes or yawns, her jaw locks. The syndrome she was diagnosed with occurs almost exclusively in girls and leads to severe impairment, affecting nearly every aspect of life: the ability to speak, walk, eat and even breathe easily. Oyintanda has spent the past eight years on her mother Sisipho Ndeleni’s back or lying in bed all day in her parents’ one-room house. A special needs school in Athlone, Mary Harding School, has asked Oyintanda’s parents to submit an application form so she can attend next year. The Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital said it remained dedicated to ensuring that Oyintanda received the best level of care possible and arranged a physio check-up for next week. “I am grateful for the help. Following the publication of Oyintanda’s story in the Cape Times, I received many calls from people wanting to donate items. "She (Oyintanda) could start going to school next year, which is our priority. The help shows there are people out there who care,” said Ndeleni. Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital spokesperson Dwayne Evans said Oyintanda had been shortlisted for a wheelchair. He said Oyintanda “will be reassessed to determine any additional needs she may have”.
