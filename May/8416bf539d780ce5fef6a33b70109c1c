The organisation geared at improving education in South Africa has been rocked by allegations of sexual harassment against three of its leaders. This prompted Western Cape Education Department MEC Debbie Schäfer to ask the organisation to cease all operations at schools in the province until she met them. The organisation said former general secretary Tshepo Motsepe, treasurer Doron Isaacs and Luyolo Mazwembe had “no regular direct interaction” with pupils, and that as soon as the allegations emerged, EE’s current leadership had ensured that they were prevented from any possible engagement. Following their meeting on Thursday, the organisation said: “It was agreed that there should at this stage be no obstacle to EE members continuing to organise in the Western Cape. "We assured the department that EE has strict sexual harassment policies in place and that EE has acted swiftly to address every sexual harassment allegation that has been put before it.” The NGO said three separate processes included an independent panel that would look into the allegations against Motsepe. “The panel may investigate any other matter that arises as part of the process or refer it to the broader assessment process. A second independent panel will investigate sexual harassment allegations against Isaacs,’’ said EE..
