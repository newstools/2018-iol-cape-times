This year, the foundation aims to go bigger and better, and beat their previous total of R3.8 million raised to help more children. Today, the Reach For A Dream Foundation, with Wimpy, will again host the annual Slipper Day fund-raising event. The initiative has been run successfully for the past seven years, raising millions of rand for children with life-threatening illnesses, and giving them hope and strength to fight another day and achieve their dreams. The concept behind this year’s campaign is centred on hope, childhood dreams and magic slippers. The campaign seeks to create an “anything is possible” environment. Through generous donations from the public, the foundation enables children to experience a wonderful moment by giving them a chance to ride bicycles, meet their role models such as sport stars, and receive the best medical treatment. Yesterday, UCT’s women’s rowing squad bought R10 wristbands, part of the fund-raising initiative, at the Golden Acre Shopping Centre in the CBD. “When I heard about this initiative, it hit home, as I have a friend who is walking on crutches because of cancer,” said team member Georgie Cowling. “She taught and inspired me not to let anything stop me from pursuing my dreams. After our morning training we decided to join the great initiative by purchasing the wristbands. We couldn’t contain ourselves, so we wore our cute and warm slippers at the same time.” Cowling said teammates took pictures of themselves in the slippers and encouraged their friends on social media to support the initiative. To participate, you can buy a R10 wristband at any Pick *  Pay store or Wimpy restaurant, which entitles you to wear your favourite slippers all day. Last year, the foundation raised R3.8m and Wimpy managed to raise R1.4m from the sale of Slipper Day bracelets in restaurants. Since 1988, the Reach For A Dream Foundation has brought hope, joy and healing to South African children.
