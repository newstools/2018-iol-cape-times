The Western Cape High Court on Friday reserved judgment on an application by former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille for an interim order which will return her to her post for at least two weeks. De Lille took on the Democratic Alliance (DA) and others in the high court on Friday in a bid to get her job back until a final determination is made by the same court on whether her dismissal from the party this week and her subsequent axing as mayor was unlawful or not. De Lille was removed from office on Tuesday, after a long-standing battle with the party's leadership and after a fractious relationship between her and members of the DA caucus in the City of Cape Town. Friday dealt with "Part A" of De Lille's application to return to her post for two weeks until "part B" of her application is dealt with.
