Running battles between police and residents ensued after a crime prevention operation yesterday. Tyres and tree stumps were set alight to block entry to the area, while police were pelted with stones. It resulted in police moving in with three specialised vehicles. They fired rubber bullets and tear gas, and questioned one person. Hangberg resident Greg Louw said police showed insensitivity by conducting another operation soon after Durick van Blerk disappeared at sea. “There must be some responsibility taken by the police. They should have known there were still heightened emotions. ‘‘They should have issued a statement when the operation was under way, as people were outraged by this disturbance,” he said. Louw said police needed to account for the trauma that had been caused by yesterday’s events. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “Police are busy with a provincial operation in Hangberg, of which details cannot be divulged at this stage until the operation is complete.” A resident, who asked not to be named, said the operation was futile as no arrests were made, and no illegal contraband was discovered at the raided homes. Ward councillor Roberto Quintas said police conducted various crime prevention activities in the area, as it had been requested by residents.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
