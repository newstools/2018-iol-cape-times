This comes as results for the Overberg and Central Karoo were not available at press time. The elections were viewed as reflective of the efforts of the regions to unify before next year’s national elections. Acting provincial ANC chairperson Khaya Magaxa spoke against factional mobilisation based on race, area and money as he opened the West Coast regional conference. Magaxa said the focus of the newly elected leadership would help the provincial ANC executive committee members to campaign to unseat the DA in next year’s elections. Giving a message of support before the West Coast region elections, ANC Youth League chairperson Muhammad Khalid Sayed said less than five years ago the region was under a task team and “was described by many as a region burdened with strife, division and infighting”, but the regional leadership had been able to deliver a regional conference. Khalid commended the previous leadership “for building the organisation and for laying the foundations for a strong and vibrant ANC in that region". “We must ensure that young people are groomed to take on leadership for they are the leaders of today and tomorrow,” he said.
