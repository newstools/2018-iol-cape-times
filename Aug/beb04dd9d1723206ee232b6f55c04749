Concern that the Department of Correctional Services has acted in breach of its own policies has led to the Judicial Inspectorate for Correctional Services (JICS) investigating mass assault allegations made by Pollsmoor Prison inmates. This is related to a search conducted at Pollsmoor on Monday night by the SAPS and correctional officers, the SABC reported. "Ninety-six correctional officers and 66 police members took part in the search in medium B section that lasted about seven hours. The operation was not video recorded, as legally required," the JICS said in a statement. The JICS said it has repeatedly raised concerns that the Department of Correctional Services acts in breach of its own policies. According to the department's incident report, the search involved two cells and was activated following several gang-related stabbing incidents the weekend before. Before the search ensued, inmates allegedly became agitated, and sponge mattresses were set alight and property damaged. Police extricated 58 inmates from the first cell. The JICS said the role of the police and the department in the search,Â as well as the authority granted for the equipment used, forms part of the investigation. "Items found in cell 1 is yet to be reported as it forms part of a forensic investigation. In cell two, 13 self-made knives and eight cellphones were confiscated. The injured inmates received medical treatment."
