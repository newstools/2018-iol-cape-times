JOHANNESBURG -  South African power utility Eskom on Thursday urged customers and businesses to use electricity wisely to ease the demand of electricity during the rotational load shedding. “Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand,” Eskom said. Eskom said on Wednesday night and Thursday morning there was no load shedding, however, the electricity system remained constrained with a high probability of rotational load shedding on Thursday night between 5pm to 9pm as a result of the industrial action which continues to impact operations at Eskom’s sites. Eskom and organised labour will again meet today through the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to resolve the impasse. “We are hopeful that all parties will put South Africa first as we endeavour in finding an amicable solution,” Eskom said. “The South African Police Services continue to maintain order and enable safe access to power stations as these are National Key Points." Eskom said their direct customers may experience a delay in response and restoration times of localised power outages. "Eskom will advise if load shedding will be conducted in either stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 or stage 4, dependent on the capacity shortage. Stage 1 requires 1000MW to be rotationally loadshed nation-wide, stage 2 requires 2000MW, stage 3 requires 3000MW and stage 4 calls for up to 4000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally at a given period. Loadshedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout." Customers were advised to keep checking their load shedding schedules on the Eskom or municipal website, and plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place. African News Agency (ANA)
