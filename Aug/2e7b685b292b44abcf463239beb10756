Five police officials from Vredenburg who allegedly colluded with members of the public to transport drugs, take bribes and falsify information have been arrested by the SAPS's Anti-Corruption Investigative Unit. Following a lengthy undercover operation the suspects, between the ages of 31 and 38, face a multitude of charges, ranging from the disclosure of unauthorised information and fraud to dealing in drugs and corruption, the SABC reported. The suspects, who have been detained in Vredenburg and are expected to appear in court on Thursday, are believed to have committed their alleged crimes while deployed to perform court and crime-prevention duties. While one officer has since resigned from the police, two sergeants and two constables have been suspended following their arrests. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said they hope the arrests will send a strong message to would-be offenders that there is no place for corrupt elements within the SAPS.
