The killings at the weekend were suspected to be gang-related. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said Bishop Lavis police were investigating a double murder case following an incident that occurred at Almond Street, Netreg at 11.20am on Saturday. “Police responded to the complaint and found two men, both aged 18, fatally wounded. One was shot and another beaten. Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation. Police are following up on all possible leads in order to bring the perpetrators to book,” Rwexana said. In another incident, a 42-year-old man died when he was shot in the head in Assegaai Avenue, Bonteheuwel, Bishop Lavis, on the same day at about 7pm. In a separate incident, a 32-year-old man was shot and killed in Cassia Street, Bonteheuwel, at about three hours later. “The killings were reportedly a result of retaliation shootings between rival gangs. The retaliation stemmed from a drug merchant who was killed about two weeks ago and was buried (on Saturday),” said Bishop Lavis community policing forum (CPF) chairperson Graham Lindhorst. Lindhorst said he met with police to discuss the issue as residents had been left traumatised by the shootings.
