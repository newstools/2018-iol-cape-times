One person was killed and at least five people wounded when they were caught in gang crossfire in Mitchells Plain on Thursday night. This in the week the City of Cape Town allocated R65 million to the SAPS to employ more metro police staff and an additional R60m for police vehicles to combat crime and gangsterism in Mitchells Plain. A young soccer player returning from practice was among those wounded, News24 reported. Lentegeur Community Policing Forum spokesperson Anthea van der Vent said some of the people involved in the shooting were known to associate with a gang, but not the boy returning from soccer practice. According to Van der Vent, three people were shot in Woodlands at an enclosed area of apartments, one person was shot at nearby Watt Court, one person in Disa Street in Lentegeur, and another in Kreupelhout Street, also in Lentegeur. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk could only confirm that a 22-year-old had been killed in the shooting. On Monday, a stakeholder meeting, attended by MEC for Safety and Security Dan Plato and MEC for Social Development Albert Fritz, was convened at Lentegeur police station to discuss possible solutions to the scourge of criminal activity in the area. "We have allocated R6m to neighbourhood watches for equipment such as bicycles, whistles and lights," Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security JP Smith said. Fritz focused on social intervention at schools, namely drilling competitions and diversionary programmes. "Children are being used by gangsters as shooters. They walk 50 metres from the police station and shoot â€“ they are all 15 and 16," Fritz said.
