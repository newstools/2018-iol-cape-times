Police have confirmed the death of Carl Lakay, implicated in an extortion syndicate, in a drive-by shooting in Belhar on Sunday. Lakay was shot five times in an apparent hit. The 45-year-old Lakay was sitting in his car in a driveway in Paarl Street at 8.30pm at the time of the shooting, TimesLive reported. Lakay was part of a group headed by Nafiz Modack and Colin Booysen‚ who were allegedly behind the takeover of nightclub security from another group‚ headed by Mark Lifman‚ Jerome “Donkie” Booysen and Andre Naude. It is alleged that both groups used extortion to strong-arm nightclub owners into paying for security services at their establishments. Lakay was expected to stand trial along with Modack‚ Booysen‚ Jacques Cronje and Ashley Fields in the Cape Town Regional Court in November on charges of extortion and intimidation relating to their alleged extortion of Grand Café Africa in Green Point. Lakay owned a security company that was allegedly linked to the group’s alleged extortion activities. His death comes after Donkie‚ alleged boss of the Sexy Boys gang‚ was shot at a Spur restaurant at Kuils River last week by a member of the rival Hard Livings gang.
