More than R100 000 in drugs were seized during a raid earlier today on a Parow building in a joint operation by members of the City’s Metro Police, the Parow branch of the SAPS, the neighbourhood watch and Community Police Forum. Friday's bust was the third this month in which officers confiscated drugs found at the old Home Affairs building in King Edward Street. "The raid started at 05:00 when officers followed up on information about drugs being stored at abandoned hot spots.The R100 000 worth of drugs found in the building include 30 grams rock cocaine, 290 grams tik, 62.5 mandrax tablets, 5 parcels dagga and 5 bankies dagga," the City of Cape Town said. "This is the third find at the same location. The items were booked in at Parow SAPS as found abandoned. "The other two raids occurred earlier on Tuesday, 7 August when officers searched the premises with K9s and found 4 mandrax tablets, 3 bankies containing tik and 19 dagga cigarettes. "The next day the officers searched the premises again with the K9s, and found 11 packets of tik, 8 mandrax tablets, 3 halves and 1 quarter." The Metro Police Department thanked the public who provided the tip-offs that led to these successes.
