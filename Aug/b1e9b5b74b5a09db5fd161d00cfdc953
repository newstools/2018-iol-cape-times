A suspect was arrested on Wednesday night after he tried to flee by firing shots at Metro Police Department officers in Manenberg. The Metro Police Department officersÂ were on crime prevention patrols in the area at about 11.20pm on the corner of Zwakop Road and Thames Walk when they spotted a suspicious male. "When the male saw the officers, he turned his back to them and pulled a firearm from his groin area and fired one shot in the direction of the officers. He then ran down Thames Walk and again fired two shots, upon which the officers returned fire," the City of Cape Town said. "The suspect ran to a house and threw his pistol on the roof of a wendy house. He was cornered and arrested. "The firearm was removed from the roof and the officers confiscated a Taurus 9mm PT 24/7 pistol with its serial number filed off, one magazine and three live rounds of ammunition." The 25-year-old man will be charged with attempted murder, illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.
