When Stormers hooker Bongi Mbonambi heard last year that he would be in the 23-man Springbok squad for the first Test against Ireland at Newlands last year, he "just kept quiet for a while and forgot to say thank you" to then Bok coach Allister Coetzee. When new Bok coach Rassie Erasmus announces his starting XV for the Rugby Championship encounter against Argentina at the weekend, it should be Lions hooker Malcolm Marx who should be reduced to silence. Marx has made an impressive return for the Lions in the latter stages of the Super Rugby competition and is the first-choice hooker, but based on his starts in the triumphs over England in the first two Tests, Mbonambi deserves to be in the starting XV. Chiliboy Ralepelle started the third Test against England. Marx was unavailable for the series against England after injuring his knee. While the 24-year-old Marx is considered to be one of the best No 2s in world rugby, Bok forwards coach Matt Proudfoot has quite rightly praised Mbonambi for the work he did against England. , "In the two Test matches that we won in June with Bongi, I think Bongi showed his quality." said Proudfoot, adding that Mbonambi was providing some stiff competition for Marx at the moment. "If you look at Steven (Kitshoff) and Beast (Mtawarira) and which one starts and which one comes off the bench, I think we're pretty much getting there with our hookers as well. It's a great place to be. "As Rassie (Erasmus) has said, the process is to build on that and create that level where we have two or three guys in the position playing at that level, so that come World Cup time we will be in a good position. "I like the competition between him and Bongi and it's also exciting to work with Akker (van der Merwe), and have a player just a little bit different to the two of them and add some spice."
