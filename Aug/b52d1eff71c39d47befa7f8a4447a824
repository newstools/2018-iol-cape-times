Christopher Jantjies was already serving life in prison for the murder of Cape Town Metro Police officer Ben Koopman. Now he has received another 12 years for killing a rival gangster in Goodwood Prison. In the plea and sentencing agreement endorsed by the Parow Regional Court on Wednesday, News24 reported, he stated that he was a member of the 26s gang. The 29-year-old Jantjies became involved in a brawl with the 28s gang as part of ongoing fights between the two groups over drugs and assaults while awaiting trial for the murder of Koopman. During the fight on June 12, 2017, a 28s gang member hit a 26s gang member on the head with a pool ball in a sock, father-of-one Jantjies wrote in his plea agreement. He said he then hit Xolosile Manjezi from the 28s gang until he fell on the ground, and then hit him repeatedly with a steel table. "My intention was to kill any member of the 28s gang in retaliation to their attack on members of my gang," stated Jantjies in his plea. Manjezi died as a result of blunt-force trauma to his head and chest, the pathologist's report stated, adding that some of his ribs were also broken and he had sustained damage to his brain. Jantjies was sentenced to life in prison in May for the murder of Koopman, who was gunned down outside his house in Eerste River in February 2016. Koopman was supposed to have been a witness in a case against the Dixie Boys gang that Jantjies belonged to. When he was shot, witnesses heard his assailants shout: "I told you I will get you!"
