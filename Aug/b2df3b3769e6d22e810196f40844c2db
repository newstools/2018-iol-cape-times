The Hout Bay Civic Association said: “As a community, we welcome the fact that the police are doing their work and want to uphold the law. "However, in upholding the law the police are not a law unto themselves. “Residents affected by today's operation were not given any search warrants, police had no name badges and shooting for no reason.” Commissioner at the SAHRC, Chris Nissen, confirmed the organisation's involvement in the case: “(The SAHRC) wants to bring stability to the community of Hout Bay and ensure that the rights of all residents are protected.” In what was first reported as a crime prevention operation by police, which was targeting guns and drug possession in the Hangberg area, community activist Lee Smith said major effort had been placed on the search of alleged poachers. “If one considers the split of their available forces, the vast majority was sent to suspected or alleged poachers,” Smith said. "This comes across as extremely insensitive on the part of the authorities considering the timing with reference to the alleged murder of Durick van Blerk.” The search for missing fisher Van Blerk is still ongoing. Smith said much of the community's frustration stems from local residents' opinion on poaching. “The response of the Hangberg community is largely because poaching is a highly debatable issue, and to many provides the only viable and sustainable income to their households," Smith said. “The manner in which the fishers of our village has been treated by government and various other authorities needs to be considered before condemning the action of our fishers.” @peter197t  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
