She says she had been smeared after the DA levelled corruption and fraud allegations against her. “I have a number of civil litigation cases lined up,” De Lille said. Without mentioning names, she said the individuals included councillors and MPs. She said two publications had already apologised for breaches in a story they published. “There are some people that said I was corrupt. I want to teach them a lesson. The principal of natural justice is that we are all innocent until proven guilty. The people who put those allegations put them as if I am guilty. My lawyers are putting the list of these people together. “I am not going to tolerate anyone who said I am guilty without any proof; they must bring proof,” said De Lille. Her looming action against detractors came a day after she and the DA agreed she would resign as mayor at the end of October and the party would drop all disciplinary hearings against her. After the agreement, De Lille said: “I want to assure South Africans that I did not make a deal with the DA (but) I took the personal decision to resign because I could no longer take the consistent abuse.” “It was very difficult decision and I trust that everyone will understand,” she said. She said in the next three months before the end of October, she would tackle housing-related issues in the City, including land invasions. “It’s going to be a very busy three months,” said De Lille.
