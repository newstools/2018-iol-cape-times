At the start of this month, the municipality’s Raubenheimer Dam was at just 30.7%, and a moratorium has now been placed on irrigation of all municipal properties. Municipal manager Allen Paulse said the council had decided to use grey water to irrigate several schools. “We are suspending irrigation of sports fields, parks and road islands with potable water with immediate effect. “These water restrictions also apply, until further notice, to the maintenance of gravel roads and streets, where large amounts of drinkable water are normally used. “We will now make opportunity on rainy days to resume maintenance of gravel roads and streets. However, areas where the public will not be adversely affected, dry-road scraping may be used when necessary,” Paulse said. The municipality’s council met to put plans in place to avert the water crisis. Discussions regarding policies related to the water crisis, such as the drought management policy, risk management plan and communication strategies, are also under way. The municipality has taken note of the City of Cape Town’s water disaster plan. “Richard Bosman, the executive director for safety and security, who has also been the chairperson of the Disaster Co-ordinating Team shared the best practices Cape Town has had during its battle with the drought in the recent months. “The Water Crisis Committee that was elected last week in a Special Council will meet to pave a way forward.” Meanwhile, the National Department of Water and Sanitation is expected to respond to the City of Cape Town’s call for the marginal lowering of water restrictions - based on dam levels - by tomorrow.
