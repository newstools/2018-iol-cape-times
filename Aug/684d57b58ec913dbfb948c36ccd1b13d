Paramedics had arrived on the scene on Monday to find the minibus taxi upright. Paramedics found that a pupil had sustained numerous injuries and was in a critical condition. It is understood that the teenager was found beneath the taxi and shortly after pulled away by the local authorities. This was the second accident in three weeks where a minibus taxi transporting children was involved in an accident and a pupil was killed. The family of the 16-year-old pupil who died on Tuesday said they want justice for their daughter. They were at the police station to open a case. A parent, Ntombizanele Ngxabani, said: “The children, including mine, are still traumatised by what happened. My child witnessed the accident as she was in another vehicle that was behind the minibus taxi. "We demand something be done as this is not the first accident involving schoolchildren and if something is not done, we will see more of these accidents. “We don’t just blame the drivers for being reckless but also the taxi owners who know their vehicles are not roadworthy.” Another parent, Nomvuzo Kali, said: “I stopped my child from using minibus taxis due to overloading and speed. She takes MyCiTi and, knowing about recent accidents, they stick with MyCiTi.”
