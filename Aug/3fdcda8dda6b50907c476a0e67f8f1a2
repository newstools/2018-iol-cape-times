An official signing ceremony was hosted by the Cape Winelands District Municipality at its council chambers in Stellenbosch yesterday. Mayor Helena von Schlicht signed the Framework Agreement on Wine Industry Development Co-operation. This cemented the region’s commitment to cultural, economic and educational exchange with its sister region 11 000km away. The Ningxia Overseas Exchange Association vice-chairperson, Yinxing “John” Zhang, said the relationship between the two regions began in 2005 and the agreement was conceptualised in 2016 to increase opportunities. “I am so excited that we are finally getting to this point after a long period, and Cape Winelands and its sister region Ningxia have gone through many changes, including leadership. “However, this never stopped the relationship and it has kept going, through the mayor and current leadership, to ensure we could finally reach this landmark,” he said. The agreement included the commitment to support co-operation within technology, wine industry infrastructure and training, bilateral trade of wine, and using the complementary advantage to meet mutual benefit. Ningxia region has the third-smallest GDP in China, which in recent years has become known for its burgeoning wine production, with close to 60000 acres of vineyards – more than double what it had in 2000. The Cape Winelands has around 94 000ha of vines producing wine grapes over an area about 800km long. Von Schlicht said the agreement promised to be an economic boost for both regions and create jobs within the wine regions. “Through this framework agreement we would like to create economic opportunities for the citizens of both regions,” said Von Schlicht. “The Cape Winelands consist of the Witzenberg, Drakenstein, Stellenbosch, Breedevallei and Swartland municipalities, which are all wine-rich regions that will benefit from the exchange agreement,” she said.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
