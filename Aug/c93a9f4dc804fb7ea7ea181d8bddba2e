A school resource officer at the Rosendal High School in Delft was accosted by three suspects dressed in school uniform at 12.30pm today. "The suspects, allegedly dressed in school uniform, attempted to rob the Law Enforcement school resource officer of her firearm," the City said. "She recognised they were not from that school. In the scuffle that ensued, they stabbed with a knife into her bulletproof vest. "She pushed a panic button on her radio device, upon which the radio control came to her aid. Her partner at the school was patrolling another section of the school premises at the time of the incident and responded to the calls on the radio. The suspects then fled the scene, but her firearm was retained." Schools are seemingly being targeted by criminals. The opportunistic robbing of pupils of their cellphones before and after school is a huge problem and pupils have been warned to be wary of strangers when walking to or from school. Thanks to a tip-off, law enforcement officers nabbed two male suspects outside Plumstead High School at about 5.40pm last Thursday. The officers had acted on a hint that there was a robbery taking place outside Plumstead High. When they arrived at the scene where the incident reportedly took place, they spotted two males running towards Prince George Road. As they were trying to ascertain reasons from the two suspects why they had been running away, a crime victim and her friend arrived and identified the duo as the ones who had robbed her of cellphone. The two suspects, age 20 and 22, were taken to the Diep River police station, where a docket was opened on charges of common robbery.
