The rapid response of Metro Police officers to a tip-off resulted in a significant drug bust on Thursday morning. Two men, aged 25 and 28, were arrested for drug dealing and detained at the Maitland police station. At around 9.30am, a member of the public informed officers of illegal drug activity taking place from an informal structure next to the Bus Rapid Transit lane along the N1, the City of Cape Town said. "The officers responded and searched the structure. They found 207 units of heroin with a street value of R7 245, as well as just over R3 600 in cash hidden underneath a bed." Meanwhile, during a joint operation with the Bishop Lavis SAPS, officers apprehended a 23-year-old male for the illegal possession of a firearm, ammunition and tik. Officers had reacted on information received following a shooting this morning in Nooitgedacht, the City said. They spotted the alleged shooter at a container in Olyfweg in Bishop Lavis. Officers searched him and recovered a 9mm Taurus pistol, 9 rounds of ammunition and 19 sachets of tik.
