The event took place last week at Bishops High School in Rondebosch. It is a current affairs quiz with a difference, in that it is focused specifically on international news from the Cape Times and SAIIA’s website. Pupils are tasked to read through 10 days of the Cape Times, plus two articles from the SAIIA website, and then on the quiz night answer 20 complex questions based on the readings, with no help from notes or teachers. The annual Inter School Quiz, which began in 1993, originated out of a hope to see all South Africans involved in the future of the nation’s international affairs. This year marks the fourth year that the Abe Bailey Trust has sponsored the event, along with donations from a variety of publishing houses, the Cape Times and local businesses. Nearly 180 contestants took part in teams of four, representing their schools for the coveted winner’s trophy, as well as the first prize of R7 500 for their school, and many other prizes. Oracle won with a stunning result of 56 points out of a possible 67, with Reddam High School Atlantic Seaboard and St Cyprians’ High School coming in a close 2nd and 3rd place with 52 and 51 points respectively. The Most Improved Cape Times Trophy was awarded to the Cape Academy for Maths, Science and Technology.
