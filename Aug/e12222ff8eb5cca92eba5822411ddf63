The stains described by forensics experts as a “bloody crotch area” on the murdered 3-year-old Courtney Pieters' jeans and panties could be that of "purged fluids caused during decomposition". This was stated in the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday by Morne Calitz, the advocate for rape and murder accused Mortimer Saunders. Calitz was cross-examining State witness Hildegarde Thunemann-Olah of the police's forensic science laboratory   Thunneman-Olah said that from the examined exhibits, she found evidence of visible blood on the crotch of the jeans, which to her indicated that a sexual act possibly occurred. Thunneman-Olah explained to the court that she had conducted presumptive tests, which included rigorous testing for possible semen and possible blood, on Courtney’s panties, jeans and a T-shirt. After pleading guilty to a murder charge at the start of the trial, Saunders argued that it was not premeditated and pleaded not guilty to the rape charge brought against him. However, he pleaded guilty to an alternative charge to rape, saying he had performed a sexual act on a corpse. Saunders will be back in the dock on Tuesday.
