A pastor, his fiancée and a "hitman" allegedly involved in a murder and insurance scam have been denied bail in the George Magistrate's Court, the SABC reported. Pastor Melisizwe Monqo, Siphosihle Pamba and Phumlani Qusheka were arrested last month in connection with the death of 25-year-old Hlompo Mohapi. They allegedly insured the mother-of-two for more than R3 million before having her killed. It's also alleged that they insured other, unsuspecting victims for over R10 million. The suspects allegedly tricked Mohapi into taking blood tests for insurance purposes. They then proceeded with securing life cover for her. A day later, she was found with her throat slit. Magistrate Phillip Mgwebile said that based on the evidence brought in court, the three can’t be trusted that they won’t intimidate witnesses; that they may interfere with the investigation of the case; and that they are likely to be a flight risk, the George Herald reported. Mgwebile also said that the trio are a danger to society and the State has a constitutional duty to protect society. Mohapi's friends and family celebrated after the court denied them bail. Investigations so far allege that the couple were the masterminds, while the third suspect was the alleged hitman. Those unsuspectingly insured are to appear as witnesses for the State. The three suspects will appear in court again on October 30.
