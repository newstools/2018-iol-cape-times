The project has provided close to 12 000 pupils access to water for their toilets and over 600 000 litres of water-saving per month to old-age homes, orphanages and mentally handicapped facilities, throughout Cape Town. Hylton Mitchell of Cops said: “Almost all of the organisations said that because of the unique circumstances of some of their residents, their laundry and toilet facilities used a large part of the municipal water supply. "They needed an alternative water source to augment the City's water supply and ease some of the financial strain many of them face in meeting their increasing water bills.” Cops worked closely with each beneficiary organisation and school to understand their water needs. “After the borehole and filtration systems were installed, the drill teams explained how the pump works, how to keep the area clean, and what to do if it breaks.” Melanie Brand, director at Woodside Special Care Centre, expressed gratitude for the initiative as they housed 80 intellectually disabled children and young adults, as well as 50 staff on any given day, which left them with a monthly water bill of R12 000. “The challenge is we have to bath our residents every day and we have to do laundry as well. “With Day Zero we didn't know what we (would) do, we asked ourselves should the facility close because we are partly funded, so we have to raise half of our budget.” The water will now be used for flushing and laundry, while it undergoes testing to see how much purification it has to undergo for drinking. Other beneficiaries included: Protea Home for the Aged (Goodwood), The Homestead - The Bridge on Elukhuselweni (Khayelitsha), Oasis Association for Intellectual Disability (Ravensmead), iKhaya - Old Age Home (Gugulethu). Scottsdene High School, Wallacedene High School, Rosendal Primary School, Cedar Senior Secondary School, Noxolo Xauka Primary School were also beneficiaries. - nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
