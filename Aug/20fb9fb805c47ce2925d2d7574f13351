They will be reuniting for a celebratory surf session in San Diego, California on Sunday. Supporters from around the US will finally get to meet Ricochet and Patrick and will surf with the dog. Ricochet pioneered the concept of kids surfing with dogs as a form of assistance, healing, therapy and empowerment when, on August 20, 2009, she made an independent decision to jump on Patrick’s board. Something like that had never happened before. A video went viral, notching up more than 12 million views on Facebook and YouTube. “I will remember that day at the beach forever,” said Patrick. “Ricochet and I caught a few waves side by side and then she decided she wanted to ride with me. When she hopped on my back it was a magical experience.   “We were in sync and could keep the board stable by helping each other. It was crazy and amazing. "The fund-raiser Ricochet held for me secured enough money to give me intense physical therapy through high school and the independence I gained in that time is incalculable,” he said. “I’ve loved watching other kids get involved and I love seeing their faces as they surf with Ricochet. "I know that she is changing their lives as much as she changed mine,” Patrick said. Ricochet holds the highest American Kennel Club title of Therapy Dog Distinguished (THDD). This extraordinary canine has surfed with hundreds of kids with special needs, people with disabilities, wounded soldiers and veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and has raised more than $500000 for over 250 human and animal causes.
