An all-women team conducted a roadblock along AZ Berman Drive in an effort to curb crime in the area. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said Operation Basadi, in collaboration with law enforcement and to celebrate Women’s Month, was a combined national and provincial initiative. “The aim was to address crimes such as street robberies and traffic violations, and curb the transportation of contraband such as drugs and firearms in the area. “The operation also aimed to create awareness of crimes against women and children, such as domestic violence and sexual offences,” Van Wyk said. The operation was executed under the command of the Mitchells Plain deputy cluster commander Mmagauta Letsoalo. “During the time of the roadblock 300 vehicles were checked and 98 vehicles, including taxis, were stopped and searched. “Thirty-eight traffic fines were issued to a total value of R39 000. About 400 pamphlets were also distributed during the campaign. “The officials had the opportunity to engage with the community, not only to sensitise them about issues regarding crimes against women, but also to keep them safe,” Van Wyk said.
