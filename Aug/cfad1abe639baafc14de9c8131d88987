Two women were arrested today for possession of dagga and were detained at the Delft SAPS. Acting on information received about dagga being kept on a field next to Stellenbosch Arterial, metro police observed  two women moving up and down a field when vehicles stopped. "After a few minutes, one female moved to her dwelling and GDTT (City of Cape Town's Gang and Drug Task Team) stepped in. The 54-year-old was found with one blue bin bag, one medium sized bag and 32 parcels of dagga. "The second female, aged 27, had in her possession four blue bin bags and eight carrier bags of dagga. The estimated weight of the dagga was about 50 kilograms, with a street value of R40 000." On Sunday night, the GDTT arrested a 41-year-old male for possession of high-grade dagga with an estimated value of R200 000. The suspect nearly collided with a metro police vehicle at a local garage and then tried to make a run for it. He was found with two packets of compressed dagga in his vehicle. Later, at his home, officers found two big bags and seven small bags of the same dagga.
