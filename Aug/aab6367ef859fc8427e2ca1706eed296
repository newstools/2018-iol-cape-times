The search was prompted by a fight among gangs starting on August 13, when one offender was stabbed. This was followed by members of the 28s gangs fighting on August 17, and two inmates being seriously injured. A group of 26s stabbed and assaulted eight 28s gang members on August 18. A 26 gang leader was assaulted, stabbed and robbed by his own gang on August 19. “The inspectorate was informed by a JIC visitor at the prison of a special search incident, which took place on August 20 at Pollsmoor Medium B Correctional Centre, which involved the activation of 96 Department of Correctional Services regional emergency support team members and 66 police members,” said JIC spokesperson Emma Cupido. “The department has indicated that some of the inmates involved have since the incident been transferred to other correctional centres outside the Western Cape, therefore we will have to identify those inmates and interview them. “There has been no evidence presented of any video footage yet, which in terms of the department’s ‘B-Orders’ policy should form part of such operations.” The JIC said they condemned the use and or smuggling of any contraband material that may endanger the lives of fellow inmates and officials within the correctional system. Department spokesperson Simphiwe Xako said 13 improvised knives and eight cellphones were found. “The situation in the cell was brought under control and about 58 inmates were removed from Pollsmoor Medium B to the Pollsmoor remand detention facility.” @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
