No one has been arrested yet regarding the robbery of a cash vehicle near Velddrif in the Western Cape, police said. Security guards were in the process of loading an ATM with money on Wednesday when a group of armed men stormed the cash vehicle, police said on Thursday. The robbers fled with an undisclosed amount of money. At this stage it's still uncertain whether anyone was injured in the incident. The police have set in motion a 72-hour action plan to try to track down the suspects, using the maximum amount of resources available to them, said a police spokesman. The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric) said last month the number of cash-in-transit heists for the first six months of 2018 had seen a marked increased compared to 2017, with 159 robberies reported in the first two quarters of this year. Sabricâ€™s Kevin Twiname said several robberies took place when cash-in-transit vehicles were doing pick-ups and drop-offs.
