Police are investigating an alleged gang-related shooting in Junction Road in Salt River on Thursday‚ where a BMW ended up on its side after colliding with several vehicles. The driver of the gold BMW reportedly sustained multiple gunshot wounds, including to the head, but his female passenger wasn't injured. "This morning at about 11:00 Woodstock SAPS members attended to a shooting incident in Junction Road, Salt River. Upon their arrival members discovered a gold in colour BMW that overturned after it collided with multiple vehicles in Junction Road," police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said. "After further investigation members noticed that there were two occupants (male and female) in the car. A preliminary investigation revealed that the male sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the body and the female was unharmed. "The victim, a 48-year-old man, was taken to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. The motive for the shooting incident is not yet known and is under investigation. An attempted murder case was registered for investigation." TimesLive reported that the wounded motorist is believed to be the brother of alleged gangster Ashley Fields. Video footage shows a man being pulled from a BMW owned by Fields, who runs a taxi business in Salt River. Fields is expected to stand trial along with Nafiz Modack‚ Colin Booysen and Jacques Cronje in the Cape Town Regional Court in November on charges of extortion and intimidation relating to their alleged extortion of Grand Café Africa in Green Point. Carl Lakay, the fifth accused, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Belhar at the beginning of the month. Lakay was part of a group headed by Modack and Booysen‚ who were allegedly behind the takeover of nightclub security from another group headed by Mark Lifman‚ Jerome “Donkie” Booysen and Andre Naude. Lakay's death came soon after Donkie Booysen‚ alleged boss of the Sexy Boys gang‚ survived yet another attempt on his life at the end of last month.
