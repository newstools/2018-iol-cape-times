The fraud and corruption case of a man believed to be part of a national syndicate that allegedly issued clearance certificates for cars that were not roadworthy has been postponed in the Bellville Magistrate's Court. The 33-year-old Elton Abrahams, from Belhar, is also facing charges of money laundering, the SABC reported. He allegedly ran an illegal licensing and police clearance certificates operation. Among seven accused, Abrahams is expected to enter into a plea agreement with the state and his trial is being held separate from his co-accused. The Hawks seized over R3 million in cash, two cars and several identity documents at his house when he was arrested in November 2016. Abrahams is out on R30 000 bail. A senior traffic official was arrested in De Aar in the Northern Cape just two weeks after the Western Cape Hawks arrested Elton Bernard Abrahams at his Belhar home for his alleged involvement in the scam in 2016.
