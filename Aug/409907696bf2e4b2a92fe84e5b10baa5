She is among women who are being profiled for their role in the wine industry, as part of the National Women’s Month (August) celebrations of the Drakenstein Local Tourism Association. A series of #winewednesdays in August acknowledge the role played by female winemakers in the region. The 26-year-old, who initially studied for a Bachelor of Science degree at Stellenbosch University, started carving out a career in the wine industry in 2010, when the wine bug bit her after inspiration from an uncle. Mpumalanga-born De Villiers maintains that wine is a form of art and that winemaking is therefore very suitable for women. “We should believe that we are able to do anything and not step back or doubt ourselves. You should never stop learning. Every day should give you something to take forward. "I think Women’s Month is very important to recognise women for the work they do in the industry and in the community.” “It is good to see that where people are inclined to see that the industry is run by men, but that it is good to make people aware that women also play a big role in the industry,” she said.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
