That’s why the Butterfly Art Project teaches volunteers and community leaders across the City in communities such as Vrygrond/Capricorn, Somerset West and Masiphumelele, to use art and fun to teach and heal youngsters who come from very difficult backgrounds. As a result, the project hosted a Superhero Puppet Workshop, attended by more than 200 people from across the City from March, to learn that superheroes and heroines are characters with superhuman powers, and are often survivors of tough backgrounds. Each of the workshops' trainees conceptualised their own superhero character, with a biography, for which they created unique puppet pieces. A total of 20 winning puppets were then selected for overseas cities to teach the healing power of art to others. The 20 puppets were chosen on the significance of their stories, the puppets’ looks and their impact, said Butterfly Art Project community care manager Zaid Philander. The puppets' creators received prizes that include stationery and gift vouchers, while the puppets’ designs would be included in promotional packs destined for overseas, he added. “The puppets are travelling on their own and they will include an industrial video with details and plans that run on an eight-week process. It’s a guide for other facilitators around the globe to implement the project in their own spheres,” said Philander. The puppets would be sent overseas to places such as London, India and Haiti, from August until the end of the year. The project worked with 360 pupils in the Capricorn area, and had served more than 7500 pupils in the past. Rotary Club of Claremont president, Dr Malcolm Dodd, said: “The Rotary Club of Claremont supports the Super Hero Indaba initiative with funds and volunteers' time to help extend the reach of the puppets as far as possible. “Every person has the power to overcome their past. We hope that this unique project will help many children beyond Cape Town.”  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
