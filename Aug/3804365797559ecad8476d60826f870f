Described as a free platform to share knowledge, the meeting is an initiative of the Heart and Stroke Foundation SA (HSFSA), in partnership with the Life Vincent Pallotti Hospital. Nuraan Cader, HSFSA communications manager, said: “This is a platform for everybody. It started out focused on those who suffered an episode and need a platform to share their experience with others. “We want everyone including friends and family to feel supported and know that you don’t have to experience this alone. It also falls on the support system to motivate the survivor to eat better, exercise and get back to full strength.” Cader said they shared valuable information, tips, tools and coping methods that help make recovery easy. And for those who had not had an episode before, it acted as a preventative measure. For Jacobs it started with a raised heart rate while trying to sleep one night. On July 31, 2015, following a similar incident, he saw a cardiologist who after a cursory echocardiogram confirmed he had a “severely regurgitated” mitral valve. Later that month, he underwent surgery to replace his mitral valve with a mechanical St Jude’s valve. Three weeks in hospital and two months of recovering at home was painful and frustrating for Jacobs. The road to healing was both physical and emotional for him, and tomorrow he will share what he went through; how he overcame a feeling of hopelessness and found the motivation to complete the Two Oceans half marathon. Afterwards those who are brave enough will have an opportunity to give an account of their experiences and how they triumphed over it. The event at Life Vincent Pallotti Hospital starts at 6.30pm.
