The MTITT wants its pre-elective conference to have all the “necessary powers” to make decisions and not be an indaba. It says this call to the mother body, the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco), fell on deaf ears. The Congress Organisation of Democratic Taxi Association (Codeta), the biggest taxi association in Khayelitsha, said the strike will go on until the pre-elective conference is held in the format it wants. Codeta spokesperson Besuthu Ndungane said: “We firstly would like to extend an apology for any inconveniences to commuters and appeal they find alternative transport.” Victor Wiwi, provincial chairperson of the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata), the biggest taxi association in Nyanga, said taxis would not operate. Santaco deputy chairperson Nazeem Abdurahman said: “Santaco distances itself from the strike. We had numerous meetings regarding the issues and MTITT walked away. A judge was appointed to intervene and give us direction but still they were unhappy with the decisions and conclusion. "They want suspended Santaco members to be part of the elections and the judge said that is not possible. The strike will be illegal because of their permit conditions.” Transport Mayco member Brett Herron said: “Should the industry indeed go ahead and withhold its services, the MyCiTi service may also be affected. “Given that the MyCiTi bus drivers also rely on the minibus taxis to get to work, some routes may be affected if the drivers cannot get to the bus depots on time to prepare for the morning peak hour service. “MyCiTi commuters are thus forewarned about possible delays.” Cape Times
