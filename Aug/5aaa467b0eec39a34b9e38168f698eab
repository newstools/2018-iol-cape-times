This warning was issued by DWS following a fraudulent scam placed on social media claiming the department is looking to hire unemployed youths in full-time positions without even possessing any skills and experience. According to the DWS, the scam claims that the department is looking to employ young unemployed South Africans with no experience. Those employed, according to the DWS, are to be paid a monthly salary of R5 729 plus benefits. The applicants need only to have grades 10, 11 and 12 to be considered for permanent positions. The department wishes to bring to the attention of social media users, especially the youth, that they should not fall for this trap. This is a scam. The DWS, as part of the government business unit, says that it always follows the correct procedures of advertising posts through the relevant legislation regarding employment of public servants. The DWS does not request job seekers to log on to the dodgy website because the employment of public servants has to follow the guidelines as prescribed by the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA). Again, the department does not have such a programme as placed on social media by these scammers. Also, emails or messages that are alleged to come from the DWS requesting information and, or demand a fee for a release of funds from the department are entirely fake “scams”. The department therefore urges recipients of such social media platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook to ignore them. Social media users receiving such scams are encouraged to visit the DWS’s nearest national or regional offices for clarity and verification purposes. Department of Water and Sanitation
