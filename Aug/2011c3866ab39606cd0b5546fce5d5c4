The Nelson Mandela Foundation has launched an official T-shirt adorned with 240 words associated with Madiba’s vision, wisdom and legacy. The T-shirt can also be worn on “Mandela Fridays”, which is a campaign to focus the attention of South Africans on strengthening democracy and the dreams of Madiba. Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers’ Union (Sactwu) spokesperson Nazmia Leite said the main purpose of Glover’s visit was to inspect operations. “It is always a great honour to get a visit from a person of his calibre. He is our Lethal Weapon. Glover has a long-standing fraternal relationship with Sactwu A few years ago he also paid a similar visit to Levi Strauss factory in Epping. He takes a keen interest in the legacy of Madiba and is keen to promote the centenary T-shirt internationally,” said Leite. Ten designers, in partnership with the Nelson Mandela Foundation and Trade Call Investments Apparel, were selected to create the designs. This has also created jobs and supported families. Many people have been wearing the T-shirts and others are still purchasing them. The goal is to sell a million T-shirts across the globe.
