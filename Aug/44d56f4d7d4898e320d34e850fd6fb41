The Drakenstein municipality is going to exchange 1.1 hectares of land for 20 hectares that belong to the Western Cape government to provide better infrastructure for existing informal settlements. The municipality has in principle agreed to the exchange initiative with the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works, News24 reported. The land, which includes parts of Paarl and Simondium, is valued at R20 million, while the market-related value of the municipality's land in Paarl, comprising tennis courts and a clubhouse, is R6.9 million. Municipality spokesperson Riana Geldenhuys said they are in the process of moving the tennis courts and clubhouse to the Boy Louw sportsfields in Paarl. Geldenhuys said the proposed swopping of land will now be advertised for public comment. According to Geldenhuys, informal settlements have already been established on the property in question and this would enable the municipality to formalise the process. Sipesihle Dube, spokesperson for MEC for Transport and Public Works Donald Grant, said the provincial government's new land would provide additional facilities for La Rochelle Girls' High School.
