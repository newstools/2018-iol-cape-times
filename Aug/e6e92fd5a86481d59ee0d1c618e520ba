On Tuesday, residents of Marikana informal settlement in Philippi marched to the Civic Centre in frustration over a lack of basic services, demanding that the City live up to its promises. On Friday, it was the turn of fed-up backyarders from Langa, Gugulethu and Nyanga to march to the Civic Centre to hand over a memorandum demanding housing, News24 reported. The protesters are of the opinion that their needs are being ignored because the City's Transport and Urban Development Authority's draft operating budget, which makes provision for housing developments in Langa, has allegedly focused on certain parts of the community to the exclusion of others. "We want houses for the community. The old Langa residents have been marginalised by the administration of the ANC and DA," community leader Bongani Nkanyuza said. "They have focused on the south-east of Langa that is the voter base. Those are the so-called hostel people. They have never accommodated the families that have been in Langa since its establishment in the late 1920s. There is a backlog of 16 years." A small crowd of about 100 angry residents stood on the steps of the Civic Centre demanding to see mayoral committee member for urban development Brett Herron and Mayor Patricia de Lille. However, it was the mayoral committee member for Area Central, Siyabulela Mamkeli, who came out to accept the memorandum.
