In need of some extra cash? Then ensure you visit @uctjustkidding’s Instagram page as well as DigsConnect's Instagram and Facebook pages on Thursday morning. Those pages will announce 10 minutes beforehand from which location R10 000 in R10 notes will be dropped from the roof of a UCT building on Thursday morning, Business Insider SA reported. Apparently it “will be on UCT Upper Campus… somewhere”. This is Cape Town-based student rental startup DigsConnect's “crazy” way to say thank you to its clients, co-founder Greg Keal said, after achieving 2 000 listings in less than a year. It has already dropped R2 000 worth of R10 notes on UCT’s Upper Campus on Wednesday morning. “We would have made no progress without the incredible support of UCT landlords and students,” Keal said. “And people are tired of boring radio ads and billboards.” About the response to this "crazy" idea, Keal said: “I think the main response was shock that we were literally handing free money out.” Keal co-founded DigsConnect with Alexandria Procter in 2017. The duo, both aged 23, met while serving on UCT’s student council. “Alexandria was being inundated with requests for accommodation as the day students co-ordinator on the SRC,” Keal said. “We knew that there had to be a better way. So we created a platform that allows students to find every type of accommodation offered in one central place.” Keal hopes the marketing campaign will push up unique browsers and listings on DigsConnect’s website.
