The union had completed a strike settlement ballot that began last Tuesday and was finalised on Friday among its members. Sactwu general secretary André Kriel said: “We announce that 75.4% of our members voted in favour of settling the strike. “We have advised Saflia (Southern African Footwear & Leather Industries Association), who represents the employers in the footwear sector negotiations, accordingly. “The strike is terminated with effect from (Monday) and Sactwu has now signed the new footwear sector substantive agreement for 2018. “Our members will receive a 7.5% wage increase and the scope of family responsibility leave will be extended to now also cover spouses.” He said the agreement is backdated to July 1 this year, the date on which increases were due. Sactwu members had embarked on a joint protected strike action with members of the National Union of Leather and Allied Workers (Nulaw) on July 9. Prior to Sactwu’s settlement, Nulaw members had ended their strike last week after settling their 2018 wage negotiations with Saflia. At the time, Nulaw’s general secretary, Ashley Benjamin, said workers in the footwear sector would receive a 7.5% increase and the family responsibility leave will be extended to also cover spouses. He said leave provisions would be extended to a member’s spouse when hospitalised and chronic or seriously ill. Other peripheral issues would be referred to a task team for further discussion while the wage increase would be backdated to July 1, 2018, with the agreement being in force for a period of 12 months.
