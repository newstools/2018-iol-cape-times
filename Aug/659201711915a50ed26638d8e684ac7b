A voice note that been doing the rounds about there being "chaos" in Wynberg, urging people to stay at home for their own safety due to the taxi strike, has been deemed a fake. The Wynberg SAPS said the "messages going around are false and the area has been quiet – apart from a minor dispute between commuters this morning. Taxi Associations are in a meeting in the CBD this afternoon and police are awaiting the outcome as well". "People there is chaos in Wynberg. Anybody who felt like coming this way please don't. Stay at home, don't come this way. It's havoc here," a woman can be heard saying on the voice note. "They almost beat down McDonalds's windows. We took pictures, I took pictures to show people at work that I am not lying. How they are throwing people out of buses, out of the taxis, you can't even take an Uber. "If they see an Uber driver stop to pick up someone, or if they see a driver stop in Main Road to pick up people, they attack the driver. So please guys stay at home, don't come this way, do not take a taxi anywhere." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
