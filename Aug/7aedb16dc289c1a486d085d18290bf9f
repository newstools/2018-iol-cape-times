Francois Beukman, chairperson of the portfolio committee on police in Parliament, has praised the police for its commitment in "cleansing the SAPS of undesirable elements". This after the arrest of five officers at Vredenburg on the West Coast on charges of fraud, drug dealing and corruption, including falsifying information and colluding with members of the public to have drugs transported. “The fight against crime begins with rooting out rogue elements within the police to ensure that only credible and dedicated officers remain in the service," said Beukman on Thursday, the SABC reported. "The arrest of these five officers is another step in the right direction in cleansing the SAPS of undesirable elements. The committee will engage the national (police) commissioner to hear how many members have been arrested in the past three years and what systems have been put in place to deal with the arrested officers.” The officers allegedly committed these crimes while they were meant to be conducting crime-prevention operations and duties at court. Four of the officers – two sergeants and two constables – were suspended, while the fifth implicated has quit.
