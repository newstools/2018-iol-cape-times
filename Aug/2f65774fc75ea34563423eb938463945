The body of Bronwyn Houghton, from Plumstead, who went missing on Sunday after she went hiking, was found next to Chapman's Peak Drive. According to the Pink Ladies organisation, the 63-year-old Houghton had told her daughter Jade she would be back at noon but did not return. Her daughter then reported her missing and search parties were deployed. A friend of Houghton’s found her car parked at Chapman’s Peak. According to a statement by the South African Police Service in the Western Cape, Houghton's body was recovered at 12.30pm on Thursday by Wilderness Search and Rescue. "The SAPS would like to thank all role-players involved in the search and rescue." Police said that it was too early to determine the cause of death. Mogammat Saabir Majiet, 23, from Bishop Lavis, is still missing and his family said earlier this week they were going through their worst nightmare as they don’t know where he might be. According to the Pink Ladies, Majiet left for work at about 5.30am last week Wednesday. He never arrived at work. The white Ford Bantam bakkie he was driving was spotted in Kleinmond last Friday. Police said a missing person docket was opened at Bishop Lavis and officers were following up on all possible leads.
