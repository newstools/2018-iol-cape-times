Waxa’s status in the council would be unchanged until the case concluded, said municipality spokesperson Chris Bezuidenhout. The three were arrested by the Western Cape Provincial Task Team established to probe the killing of Malosi. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: “The alleged gunman, a councillor and an employee of the municipality were arrested after the SAPS obtained a section 204 witness statement. They have been charged with murder.” Malosi was shot dead just metres from home after attending a school meeting. Southern Cape police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie said a fourth person had been released due to insufficient evidence. Knysna mayor Mark Willemse said the news of Waxa’s arrest and subsequent court appearance was shocking but that he was innocent until proven guilty. The Molosi family’s spokesperson, Aseza Gungubele, said: “We always maintained the murder was politically motivated and had to do with recent events in council.”
