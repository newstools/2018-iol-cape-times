More than 40 people arrested for public violence during a clash with police at the George taxi rank on Thursday are expected to appear in the local magistrate's court on Monday. A taxi blockade ensued on the main road in George after more than 14 taxis had been impounded, the SABC reported. The blockade ended when taxi bosses agreed to temporarily end their strike following the release of their vehicles the provincial traffic department's ghost squad had impounded. Many taxis are transporting commuters again on despite a call from taxi bosses to continue with the strike going. Police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie said officers are still maintaining high visibility in the area. The Public Order Police Unit, the traffic departments – both the provincial and municipal – were deployed, said Pojie. "At the end of the day we've arrested 47 people, 44 of them for public violence-related matters pertaining to the taxi stand-off in York Street," said Pojie.
