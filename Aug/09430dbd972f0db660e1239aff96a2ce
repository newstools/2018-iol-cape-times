The circumstances surrounding the death of an unknown man are being investigated after his body was discovered in the Milnerton lagoon earlier today, police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said. It is suspected that the man drowned. A death inquest case docket has been registered. According to the City of Cape Town, the body was recovered by SA Police Service divers. In July last year, three people were rescued and a man drowned after a rescue attempt at Milnerton lagoon beach. Two men had swum out to help two women in trouble in the water around 4pm, Disaster Risk Management Centre spokesman Wilfred Solomons-Johannes said at the time. "During the rescue attempt Jerome Booysen, 35, found himself in distress and was swept away by a strong rip current. His friend and the two women were recovered by a surfer... Booysen is feared lost at sea." Solomons-Johannes said the three then "absconded from the scene". In January 2016, the body of a 26-year-old man was found at Milnerton lagoon beach. The 26-year-old from Delft had not been reported missing and his friends had not realised he had been in difficulty at sea.
