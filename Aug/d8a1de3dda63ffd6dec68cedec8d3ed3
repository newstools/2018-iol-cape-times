CAPE TOWN - Data published by the Franchise Association of South Africa (FASA) shows that the sector’s performance remains postive and continues to see growth. According to a report by Business Tech, the industry not only experienced growth in the number of franchises opening up over the past year but also saw revenue increases across major brands. In 2017, the sector consisted of 845 franchisors and over 40,000 franchisees. The report stated that the sector employed about 343,000 people and generated sales of R587 billion. This equals 13.3% of the country’s GDP, up from the 9.7% recorded in 2014. Research from global analytics group Euromonitor, published by the Financial Mail, shows how revenues across 20 major fast food franchises in South Africa increased between 2016 and 2017. We decided to shorten the list and focus on who the top ten food franchises are in SA. Here is the list outlines the growth in revenue, as reported by Euromonitor, as well as how much money each brand makes per franchise. Additionally, Nando’s had requested Business Tech to remove its financial information and asked that its revenue not made publicly available. .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-siak{background-color:#3531ff;color:#ffffff;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top} .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-siak{background-color:#3531ff;color:#ffffff;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top} - BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
