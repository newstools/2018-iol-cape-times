She is expected to be sentenced at Bellville Commercial Crimes Court on September 4. Brady, who was also the chairperson of the Oostenberg sub-council, fraudulently appointed a service provider to build 33 low-cost houses worth approximately R3million in Malibu Village in Blue Downs without following due tender processes. She further misrepresented the provincial human settlements department by providing a letter of appointment to the service provider on behalf of the department Brady appeared in court on Friday where she reportedly broke down, pleading for a suspended sentence. She could not be reached for comment on her reasons to withdraw her party membership. DA provincial spokesperson Odette Cason would not say whether a disciplinary hearing was instituted, only telling the Cape Times that she was no longer a councillor when she ceased her membership. “She voluntarily withdrew her membership with the party. Unfortunately, I have to wait for more information and our leadership is currently in a provincial executive meeting. But at this stage that is all I can say about it,” said Cason. Cape Times
