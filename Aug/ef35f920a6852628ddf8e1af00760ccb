The EFF has pleaded ignorance over the alleged Stellenbosch "land invasion" which escalated into clashes with police around Kayamandi on Monday. The owners of Louiesenhof Wines obtained an urgent interdict at the weekend to remove unoccupied structures, and to prevent more people from moving onto a vacant portion of their property. Housing MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela said last month the recent protests for houses would be the tip of the iceberg if the slow rate and skewed delivery of houses by local municipalities continued. "The interdict didnâ€™t authorise the demolition of any shacks and therefore only the building materials of those who did not voluntarily remove their building materials were confiscated," said Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk. Stellenbosch EFF councillor Derrick Hendrickse insists that it had not been planned, but was merely a response by backyard dwellers who had raised their need for land with the municipality in May, News24 reported. "I was told, 'Look, this is not a political initiative. We don't want the EFF involved. We don't want any political parties involved'. It's driven by people across political affiliations," said Hendrickse. "They are doing it, (the occupation is) not under the hat of the EFF or the ANC, or the DA. They didn't want me to come in there with my EFF beret. They said, 'this not a political thing'." The party's treasurer in the Winelands, Zukisa Xegwana, said he was called urgently, while at work on Monday, by people upset that machines were breaking down their shacks. The evictions were being carried out by the Red Ants following instructions by the Sheriff of the Court.
