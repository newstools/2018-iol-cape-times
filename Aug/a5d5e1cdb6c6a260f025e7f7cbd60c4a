In Firgrove, just before 5pm yesterday, officers received a tip-off about illegal firearms being stored at premises in Port Jackson Avenue, the City said. "The officers executed a search warrant and as they entered the house, an occupant ran towards a window and threw something wrapped in a towel outside.
