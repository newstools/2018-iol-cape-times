Llewellyn Jenniker is 45 and has been living on the street for 30 years. Cecilia Absolom is 42 and has been on the street since the age of 14. Thanks to the City’s Safe Space on the Foreshore, they were able to exchange vows during a ceremony that formed part of a Women’s Month event.   They’ve been together for their entire stay on the streets and were living in Dock Road before moving to the overnight Safe Space last month. They were among the first group of people to start using the facility. Their 12-year-old son lives with his paternal grandmother and the couple hope to find more permanent accommodation for themselves in due course.   For the moment, they continue to use the facilities and services that the Safe Space offers. Soon, they will also start working via the Expanded Public Works Programme.   The City’s Safe Space is a pilot project designed to provide a safe place to sleep at night, give access to ablution and storage facilities as well as social services.   ‘Llewellyn and Cecilia’s big day first came up when we officially launched the Safe Space in the latter part of July. I’m so happy that now, just a month later, their dream has become a reality,” said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security; and Social Services, JP Smith.   “There were a number of people and organisations who committed to help make this day possible and, on behalf of the City, we thank them. We will continue to work closely with Llewellyn and Cecilia.    “They’ve both been on the streets for a very long time, but they are looking to the future. Our Social Development Department is on hand to help guide them and anyone else living on the street along the path of reintegration.    “This is a fairy-tale day for the couple and I want to see them have the fairy-tale ending too.”
