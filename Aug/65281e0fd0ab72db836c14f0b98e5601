Inganathi Mafenuka, 22, from Khayelitsha, gave birth to the quadruplets on July 6 through a Caesarean section. Mafenuka said she was happy she would be taking her children home. The healthy babies, two boys and two girls, weighed only 980g, 1 010g, 830g and 1 030g at birth, and have since doubled in weight. The babies, Bubele, Buchule, Bunono and Bungcwele, now weigh 2040g, 1770g, 1580g and 1980g. “A big thank you to all the staff who looked after me and my babies, from my appointments to the delivery. I am very grateful to each and every one of you, especially the gynaecologists, neonatology, anaesthetists, theatre and nursing staff. I’m overwhelmed by the generosity of the people of Mzansi who opened their hearts to myself and my babies,” said Mafenuka. She said she was lucky the babies have a tendency of not all crying at the same time. “It has always been a bliss, I am overwhelmed with joy. My mother feels like a queen, she is very happy for us.” Tygerberg Hospital spokesperson Laetitia Pienaar said the birth of quadruplets happened rarely. “It was more than 10 years later for Tygerberg Hospital,” Pienaar said. “We are very excited at the progress the quadruplets have made. They are getting stronger every day. The mother is doing extremely well and adjusting to motherhood very well,” said Pienaar. The quadruplets were expected to be introduced to the world outside the hospital for the first time today. “This will be their first photos,” she said.
