No one was injured after a house in Lentegeur burnt down after being petrol-bombed in an incident believed to be linked to the ongoing gang war. It was not the first time the house had been targeted. According to City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue spokesperson Theo Layne, they attended to the house in Tulip Street around 22.32pm on Wednesday. "According to reports, a petrol bomb was thrown at the house and one shot was also fired in that direction. The house burnt down during the incident," said police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana. No one was injured and no arrests have been made. Police are investigating a case of attempted murder. Lentegeur Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Byron de Villiers told News24 they believed the attack might be linked to a fight between the Junior Cisco Yakkies and the Fancy Boys. "The very same house had a hand grenade thrown at it a few weeks ago. Before that, another petrol bomb was thrown there (earlier this year)," he said. De Villiers said there had recently been several shootings in Lentegeur and Woodlands. The CPF was expected to hold a candlelight vigil against the ongoing gang violence on Eisleben Drive on Friday evening.
