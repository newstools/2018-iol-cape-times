Two men have been wounded in a shooting incident in Mitchells Plain on Friday. The circumstances surrounding the shooting in the Portlands part of Mitchells Plain are still unknown, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said. He said the incident was still under investigation. The suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested, he added. The escalating gang warfare in Mitchells Plain has resulted in nine murders in less than a month. Six people were arrested this week for an alleged mob attack on two men police said had been accused of housebreaking in Emsindweni informal settlement in Khayelitsha. The two were severely assaulted and set alight and killed. The men were undressed, their feet and hands were tied, and they were interrogated while being assaulted with sticks, pipes, stones and bricks. Traut said the policeâ€™s Harare tracing team worked tirelessly to apprehend the six suspects. They included a 43-year-old woman and five men aged between 24 and 43.
