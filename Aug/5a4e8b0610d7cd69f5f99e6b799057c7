One of the accused in a gang-related shooting incident in which a six-month-old baby was shot in the head in Ocean View last year has been sentenced to four years' imprisonment by the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday. Simaney Cupido had entered into a plea bargain. In January last year, baby Zahnia Woodward was killed while sitting on her father's lap, the SABC reported. Cupido was one of six suspects facing 15 charges ranging from murder, attempted murder, and illegal possession of firearms and ammuntion. She was convicted on a charge of defeating the ends of justice. They allegedly attempted to shoot and kill 12 other people at Ocean View, near Simon's Town. The case against the other five suspects continues. One of the men who allegedly killed Baby Zahnia “laughed” after she was shot. This was stated by her grieving mother Cindy Woodward, 20, after the shooting. Zahnia’s father, Bradley Robyn, was shot through the upper thigh. Robyn was holding the baby on his lap when five men in a white VW Golf shot at them and three friends in the drive-by shooting. They had been waiting at a bus stop for Woodward to come home from work.
