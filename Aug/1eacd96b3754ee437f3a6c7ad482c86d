Hermanus land activist Gcobani Ndzongana's arrest on charges of incitement and malicious damage to property in July sparked violent protests in the Zwelihle township in July. On Friday, he had charges of crimen injuria withdrawn against him, News24 reported. The Correctional Services officer still had pending charges of public violence and incitement against him when he was arrested on similar charges on July 11. He remains in custody for his trial in October on charges of public violence and incitement. His lawyer, Mafu Masina, said on Friday the charges had been withdrawn after representations were made to the director of public prosecutions in the Western Cape. Community leader Sicelo Gxamesi said after the court's decision: "We're happy, we're just looking forward to the next court appearance." Hermanus Mayor Dudley Coetzee told News24 relations were improving between residents of Zwelihle and the greater Hermanus community, after protests over land in March. The incarceration of Ndzongana was still a source of tension, he said, but negotiations were under way between the provincial human settlements department and a private property owner to buy a plot of land. It is hoped an agreement will resolve complaints of a shortage of affordable housing in the area. Protests flared up in March when a group of Zwelihle residents went to the municipality to say they would be setting up homes there and expected utilities to be provided for them. The Red Ants were sent in to remove them, triggering further unrest.
