JP Smith, the mayoral committee member for safety and security; and social services, was "very disappointed" to learn of the arrest of a City of Cape Town traffic warden in Nyanga on Thursday night. The warden and two accomplices apparently impersonated law enforcement personnel by staging a fake vehicle checkpoint in the area. They were rounded up by SAPS at about 9.30pm. "The motive is not clear, although I’m sure it will emerge as the investigations continue. The warden was off-duty at the time and was using his private vehicle, but he had Traffic Department equipment in his possession, including a trunk radio and his appointment card. His accomplices were dressed in traffic uniform too. "While the SAPS will conduct a criminal investigation, the City’s SSIU will proceed with an investigation into the member and his conduct. "He has already been served with a pre-suspension notice. The warden and his accomplices are in custody and will appear in court on Monday. "The City of Cape Town works very hard to build good relationships with our communities – acts like these simply serve to undermine our efforts and we will not tolerate it."
