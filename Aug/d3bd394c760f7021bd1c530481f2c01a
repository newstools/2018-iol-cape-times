The brother of alleged Sexy Boys gang boss Jerome "Donkie" Booysen, Colin, and suspected underworld kingpin Nafiz Modack are on high alert after he was shot and wounded. The man believed to have shot and wounded "Donkie" at a mall in Kuils River on Wednesday afternoon was in the Cape Town Regional Court last week when Colin appeared, News24 reported. The gunman was killed after the firearm he was using jammed, according to sources, which probably saved Donkie's life. Colin Booysen, Modack, Jacques Cronje, Ashley Fields and Carl Lakay appeared in the Cape Town Regional Court on Thursday for allegedly extorting people in an effort to take over the nightclub security business in Cape Town. Bruce Hendricks, for Colin Booysen, told magistrate Byron Pedro that the gunman shot dead on Wednesday "was at this very court last week following my client". Modack's counsel, advocate Edwin Grobler, said his client surrounded himself with security personnel because a bounty or hit had been placed on him, according to information conveyed by the police. Both lawyers were concerned that their clients' safety was being jeopardised because police officers consistently took bodyguards back to the police station after court appearances to check that they were licensed security officers and that their firearms were legal.
