Pupils of two Tulbagh schools were prevented from going to school today due to ongoing protests in the area. The situation calmed down in the afternoon. All major routes into the town were closed off with burning tyres, the SABC reported. Several businesses were also forced to close their doors. Witzenberg municipal manager David Nassen said the Civic Association of Tulbagh, in a memorandum, is demanding that shacks erected in the informal settlement be broken down. He said they are alleging housing allocations are unfair and that preference is given to people from outside the town. "The mayor felt that some of the requests within the memorandum will create division. The community then went to the streets this morning and they blocked certain roads," Nassen said. "We again met some of the leadership and at the meeting we resolved that they will amend the memorandum and then they will hand it over to the mayor on Thursday." The Western Cape Education Department said it is unacceptable that two schools had to be closed today due to unrest, and wants the parties involved to resolve their issues as soon as possible. "It is unacceptable that our schools have had to close during this period, affecting the education of more than 2 000 learners. The safety of our learners and educators is paramount. "We are pleading with those involved to end the violence and find alternative and constructive ways of communicating their grievances so that our learners can return safely to their schools, and that teaching and learning can continue."
