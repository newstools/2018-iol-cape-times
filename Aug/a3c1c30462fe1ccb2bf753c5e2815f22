“We were promised nine street lights and out of the nine, we were told three would be installed and working by December 2017 while the rest would be operational in April. One was installed and even that one is not working. "This is not the first time we are here saying people are dying and safety of children and women is at risk,” said community leader Xolani Tukwayo. The killing of 11 people on the same day last year led to some residents fleeing the area. This prompted community leaders to demand electricity and street lighting. Mayco member for informal settlements, water and waste services Xanthea Limberg accepted and signed a memorandum of demands yesterday. The demands include residents wanting reblocking done in the area, proper and dignified sanitation, an upgrade to Protea Road and the City to buy the private-owned land so that they can enjoy all basic services. Limberg said: “The Marikana settlement formed on a number of private properties as a result of an illegal land invasion and it is the subject of a pending court case. “The City, however, conducted a site visit today (yesterday) and can confirm that services in the area are functioning. “These services include portable toilets, standpipe taps and a fully serviced refuse collection operation. The City is also providing sandbags to assist with flooding in the area. The City has been in constant contact with the leadership of Marikana.” She said in light of humanitarian concerns, the City is also in the process of erecting high-mast lights on City-owned land on the boundary of the settlement along Sheffield Road. “To this end, the City will be erecting five 30m high-mast lights as per the agreement with this community. The City can confirm that the first high-mast light was successfully installed today (yesterday)and is operational,” she said.
