The firing of an allegedly racist KFC manager at the Somerset West branch has been met with mixed feelings by the union representing KFC workers. Some employees claimed she had repeatedly called them “a bunch of monkeys”. They said the manager had threatened to fire them after they approached their union regarding her alleged remarks. The public affairs director for Africa KFC, Thabisa Mkhwanazi, said the manager was dismissed following an external probe and an in-depth internal disciplinary process by human resources. The Democratised Transport Logistics and Allied Workers' Union (Detawu) said KFC had been dragging its feet in investigating the allegations, which were reported in March, the SABC reported. Detawu secretary Brightness Matwa said the manager had not only repeatedly referred to workers as a "bunch of monkeys", but used other derogatory terms too. Matwa said KFC started its investigations only after exposure in the media. “They only succumbed to pressure that was put on them by the media. So in essence they could not be praised for doing that because they did all to cover up the racial conduct of their manager. This manager has actually been let off the hook for a long time.” Employees said the first time she allegedly made racist remarks was when an inspector was due to visit the store. She was allegedly angry and said “I don’t know why I’m placed with a bunch of monkeys”. “We were unhappy but kept that to ourselves because... we thought she had just said that out of anger, but it happened again,” the employees said. “One of us was also sent away, as if she was the ‘troublemaker’, to work in another store. She has been brought back... and we are working under another manager.”
