More than 350 different plant species will be exhibited in the church from today until September 2. Alida Stone, chairperson of the show, said she cannot wait for visitors to “witness the amazing exhibitions”. “We believe that our hard work will be worthwhile in the end when it all comes together for a wonderful extravaganza. Volunteers start early in the chilly mornings and work very hard on the exhibitions,” Stone said. The area in and around the Flower Church has been a hive of activity while the construction of the exhibitions was taking place. The volunteers were doing “prep” work by arranging flowers such as purple violets in recycled tins that will form part of the exhibitions. The volunteers who pick the plants and flowers have special permits that allow them to do so. And, in the corner of the Flower Church, there is a huge waboom. The show officially opened yesterday where patrons had a sneak peek of the landscape exhibition. “The Clanwilliam Wildflower Association aims to cultivate awareness and responsibility towards the indigenous flora of this region,” said Stone. According to Daleen Schoombee, who works in the species room of the show, there are many wildflowers this year that she has rarely seen before, like the yellow bobbejaantjie. The purple bokhorinkie is also smaller than bokhorinkies of the previous years, she says. The reason for this phenomenon is the unique rainfall pattern experienced over the last few years. Sue Bergh, one of the designers and creators of the Wildflower Show, explained that, although there was enough rain to provide a beautiful spectacle of wildflowers, it still seems that some plants and flowers were getting too little rain. Tickets for this event are available at Emil Strassberger, Nancy’s Tea Room or at Reinholds Restaurant at R250 per person. Only cash is accepted for the purchase of the tickets.
