Pretoria - The organisers of the recent #TotalShutdown march to the Union Buildings will no longer be facing criminal charges, National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole said on Monday. This comes hours after the national conveners of the march said police members had laid charges against organisers of the Tshwane march and ordered them to hand themselves in following a clash with police that left one woman injured. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo in a statement said Sitole had viewed the case opened against the organisers and was surprised at the move. "At no stage was SAPS management informed that the protesters had transgressed in any way before, during or after the protest march. "Therefore, SAPS management finds it surprising that a case of such a nature would be opened." Naidoo added that: "In light of this, a decision has been taken to close the docket as being unfounded." "Furthermore, the allegations made by some of the protesters that they have allegedly been violated by police during the protest is also being viewed very seriously by police management." Naidoo confirmed that as a result, four cases have been opened against police and these would "be treated with the priority they deserve". IOL
