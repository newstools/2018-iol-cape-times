Pupils from 21 Stellenbosch and Franschhoek primary schools gathered in the Coetzenburg Centre recently for the annual e’Bosch School Choir Festival, and were accompanied by the Stellenbosch University Wind Band under the baton of Pamela Kierman. The pupils sang, among others, Song for Mandela together with soloist Terence Petersen. Festival project manager Tarnia van Zitters was beaming with the success of the event. “We are very happy for a successful event and the fact that we could celebrate the Nelson Mandela Centenary. We also thank the Stellenbosch University Wind Band and their conductor Pamela Kierman which accompanied the mass choir as well as Terence Petersen the soloist in the Song For Mandela,” said Van Zitters. The 21 primary schools which took part were AF Louw, Cloetesville, Devon Valley, Pieter Langeveld, Rietenbosch, St Idas, Dalabuhle, Groendal, West Eind, Bridge House, JJ Rhode, St Vincent RC, Klapmuts, Vlottenburg, Raithby, Weber Gedenk, Dorothea Special Needs, Nondzame, Pniel, PC Petersen and Simondium.
