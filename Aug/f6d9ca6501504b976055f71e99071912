This is one of several changes in the pipeline for the City of Cape Town’s environmental health service, which is being bolstered by a R9.2 million injection for 14 new posts. Monitoring of food manufacturers forms part of the city council’s environmental health practitioners’ general workload. However, the globalisation of the food trade is changing the patterns of food production and distribution, requiring more vigilance. Mayoral committee member for safety and security and social services JP Smith said the city council doing a sterling job to ensure the safety and integrity of food supply. “We are, however, living in an ever-changing landscape and the countrywide listeria outbreak last year was a devastating reminder of just how important food safety was,” he said. “We have more than 800 food manufacturers in Cape Town that produce for the local and international markets. The new food control unit will focus on these manufacturers as well as dairy farms. "It is also an opportunity to improve monitoring of products coming into Cape Town and ensure that these are legally compliant and safe for consumption.” The unit is expected to provide improved guidance to manufacturers and ensure compliance, help solidify the application of labelling regulations, ensure uniformity in the implementation and interpretation of new legislation across the city and improve surveillance, monitoring and enforcement of legislation. All food-related legislation is consolidated under the National Foodstuffs Act. The surveillance, monitoring and enforcement aspects are where a dedicated unit can have an impact on guiding the industry, ensuring improved compliance and more customer-centric service delivery, Smith said. In addition to the specialised food unit, he added, the city council will reconfigure its noise control unit. Two different sections previously dealing with the same issue will be consolidated into a single unit, to enable a shorter response time.
