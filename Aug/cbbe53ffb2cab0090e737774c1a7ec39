The marchers, led by members of the Parow Business and Community Forum, vowed they would no longer tolerate any form of crime in the area and asked Parow station commander Raymond Jacobs to inform his officers to stop turning a blind eye to their complaints. Resident Sipho Zanazo said: “Today is a big day. We are taking back our streets and fighting against crime. We will continue to work together to fight crime, not only today but every day.” Parow Business and Community Forum chairperson Jameelah Moodley said crime has got out of control and was affecting mostly the elderly and businesses. “We are tired of the brutal attacks and have vowed to fight crime and not be intimidated. The area is not safe. It is overrun by drug dealers, which attracts more crime. "Drugs is the norm of the day. Merchants are selling their drugs legally in front of us to young children in broad daylight. Shops are being robbed at gunpoint,” said Moodley. He conceded that some shopkeepers bought stolen items from criminals. Residents also demanded a satellite police station at the Parow taxi rank on the Northlink College side be opened. They believe that would stop criminals coming to Parow from other areas. The police were given 14 days to respond to the community. Jacobs said he accepted the memorandum. “They complained about being robbed, drugs and other issues. The issues we can’t handle at station level will be passed on and addressed by the next level of power. “We will attend to the ones we can and are looking forward to working with the community.”
