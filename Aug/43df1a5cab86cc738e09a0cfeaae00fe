An argument with her foster parents about her allegedly telling a lie led to 17-year-old Nateliene Esterhuyse running away from home. The argument occurred on Sunday and her foster parents were last aware of her whereabouts while she was smoking outside their house at 5am on Monday. But luckily she returned to her Worcester home on Tuesday night after the police helped search for her, Netwerk24 reported. Her foster mother, Maryke Booysen, said they were highly relieved when she returned home at 9.30pm on Tuesday. She went to her brother's home in Cape Town, but never knocked on his door and instead took the train back to Worcester, Booysen said. She then went to a friend's house. "They came to our house together. I don't know what she has eaten since Monday or where she slept. Her disappearance rocked many people's lives. We got a big fright. "I'm going to watch her closely from now on," said Booysen. Her father, Johan Esterhuyse, who lives in Wellington, said: "I was emotionally broken. She had had an argument with her foster parents on Sunday evening about a lie she told." When they wanted to take her to school on Monday, she was nowhere to be found, said Esterhuyse, who added that his daughter had run away before. He said he "doesn't know how to help her any more".
