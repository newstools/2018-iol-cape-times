“The new committee has not been transparent in what they want to do with the Cape Town Press Club. They have not said why it is so important that half of the eight-person committee is linked to one venture (that has now been deferred temporarily). "One can only surmise that they want to take the Cape Town Press Club in a commercial direction; this is not why it was established,” said Van Wyk, the club’s first black co-chairperson. The Cape Town Press Club recently came under fire from Van Wyk and parliamentary communication services division manager Moloto Mothapo for its all-white, predominantly male committee, with Mothapo saying the club had reverted “to its old pre-1994 self”. Van Wyk penned in a published letter that during a committee meeting held about two months before the club’s AGM, now club chairman Brent Meersman told the committee that Donwald Pressly, who had previously been dismissed by Independent Media following an internal disciplinary process over his conduct in 2014, would not stand as a candidate for any committee position. Regarding the accusation around The Cape Messenger, Meersman said: “Alarmed by Van Wyk’s accusation, as soon as the new committee met my first order of business was to ask the eight other committee members to declare any interests they might have in The Cape Messenger. “As the minutes recorded then and subsequently approved reflect as follows: Pressly said he was an editor; one member had a 1/100th share, and one member’s reporting is used by the Messenger from time to time. That is the extent of it,” Meersman said.
