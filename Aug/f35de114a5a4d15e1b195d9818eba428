The metro police have arrested three suspects on a charge of arson after they were allegedly caught setting fire to the roof of the OR Tambo Hall in Khayelitsha. Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said the trio were part of a group of protesters who were demonstrating in the areaÂ before they targeted the hall, the SABC reported. He said the extent of the damage has yet to be determined. "It is disappointing that the building, which was damaged in recent protests, has been targeted again. "This very hall was also damaged during protests in June this year and now, once more, we'll have to spend money on repairs that could have been used elsewhere and aiding community development. "Hopefully, the courts will come down hard on the suspects and send a message to those engaging in public violence that there are consequences for their actions," said Councillor Smith.
