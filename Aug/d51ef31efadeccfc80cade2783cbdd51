Prinsloo, an animal inspector at the Animal Welfare Society Helderberg, was helping cattle across the highway near Shell, Macassar, when he was hit. Organisation manager Julia Evans said Prinsloo had often gone to the rescue of cattle, wildlife, “and many other weird and wonderful creatures”. He could be found most mornings feeding animals on various street corners of the Strand. The dogs got to know him well, Evans said, and with the last devastating fires, Prinsloo not only assisted in the evacuation and rescue of many animals, but alongside his colleague, he helped to keep the raging flames from consuming a home belonging to people he didn’t know. “On behalf of Animal Welfare Society Helderberg, it is with a devastated heart that I must confirm that Inspector Pieter Prinsloo was tragically killed. “Pieter first joined our society in December 2010. From the get-go he was passionate about his work, and at the time of his death he was still officially ‘in the field’. “In my mind’s eye, images of Pieter over the years roll past. Rescuing injured animals, chasing down difficult strays, working with the fire brigades and various security companies to get cats out of trees, breaking up dog fights, wading out to sea to retrieve dogs stranded on banks,” said Evans. Many social media users have sent their condolences to Prinsloo’s family. Diana Truter, who said she worked as an inspector herself, said she knew what Prinsloo experienced day to day. “It is a huge loss for animals and for his organisation. I truly wish you will be able to stand strong and continue to do all your good work. “I carry his family and his colleagues in my heart. I wish you well,” Truster said.
