The police’s reaction unit had to be brought in to stabilise and prevent further shootings in the community as tension rose on Tuesday, according to the area’s Community Policing Forum. Residents calling for more resources in Kensington/Factreton were angry by yet another person caught in the crossfire. The teenager was rushed to hospital after being hit in the head by a stray bullet. A 26-year-old man was wounded. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said cases of double murder and two attempted murders were under investigation. He said police visibility in the area has been increased. “According to information, the first incident occurred at 5.20pm at Dromedaries Square (where a ) 26-year-old man was shot and wounded. A 26-year-old man was shot and fatally wounded at 8.25pm in Lysander Street. "Another shooting occurred at 9.08pm at Ventura Street. According to reports, a 40-year-old man was shot and fatally wounded. The community alerted police and the victim was found with gunshot wounds. The other victim, a 19-year-old woman, was wounded on her head.” Acting chairperson of Kensington Community Police Forum Erika Isaacs said they needed a satellite police station to add more resources. “The Reaction Unit left once they saw things were coming and said hey would be on standby. That is not what we need. We need more police on the ground because visibility does make a difference. "The police are trying to do what they can but it’s not enough."
