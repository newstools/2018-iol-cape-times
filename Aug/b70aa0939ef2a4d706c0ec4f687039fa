Zokwana was responding publicly on the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) approaching the court to challenge the department’s total allowable catch (TAC) for the West Coast rock lobster. He said a balance had to be struck between socio-economics and the take from the ocean. Zokwana said scientific data was considered when allocating quotas. “Allocation of fishing rights to the previously disadvantaged sections of our society is my priority. A lot of work is being done in this regard to open more access through quotas, so that fields are level for entrance. "Ocean economy carries with it massive opportunities for this country; it has the potential to unlock great numbers of employment opportunities while facilitating many downstream and upstream business opportunities. “It is in this regard that the department has been dragged to court by WWF for us to reduce significantly the total allowable catch in West Coast rock lobster,” Zokwana said. WWF-SA has taken the department to court over alleged failure to sustain long-term survival of the species. They want the 790 tons of TAC to be declared invalid, and on August 22 the court will hear the WWF’s semi-urgent notice of motion. In a founding affidavit, WWF senior manager for marine programme, John Duncan, said the WWF’s mission is to stop the degradation of the natural environment Approached for comment, WWF yesterday said it won’t be commenting due to the pending court action. The final list of small-scale fishers for the Northern Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal was approved, and only the Western Cape was outstanding due to investigations, Zokwana said. “We are moving with great speed in maximising entrances of the previously disadvantaged people and communities to the fishing business as part of deepening diversity and economic transformation.”  francesca.villette@inl.co.za
