The Metro Police Department arrested four suspects for the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition in Athlone today. The suspects were spotted by a camera operator of the Eagle Eye CCTV system, who in turn informed officers attached to the Camera Response Unit. Officers followed up and found the firearm hidden in long grass in the yard of a house in Bokmakierie. They recovered a 9mm pistol and 17 rounds of ammunition. The officers arrested four suspects between the ages of 24 and 27 for possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. They were detained at Athlone SAPS. Earlier today, police arrested three suspects in Bothasig in connection with the illegal possession of abalone. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said two delivery vehicles were searched during a roadblock that was held in De Grendel Road. He says 37 bags filled with abalone were found in the vehicles. The quantity and value are yet to be determined by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The suspects, all in their fifties, are due to make a court appearance in Goodwood once charged.
