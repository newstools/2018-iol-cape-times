A mother-of-two from Wellington has been named South Africa's new boerewors champion. In a case of never say die, Yvonne Blaauw won the competition on her 16th attempt, the SABC reported. The 47-year-old Blaauw has been working in the butchery of a Shoprite Checkers store for 20 years. She walked away with the grand prize of a Toyota Hilux DC 2.8 GD-6 Raider worth more than R516 000. The well-known retailer announced the winner of its 26th championship boerewors contest in Cape Town on Wednesday, which started off as an in-house cook-off. It was opened to the public in 2001. The culinary experts at the South African Chefs Association once again oversaw the judging process. All the entries went through a validation process to ensure that the recipes adhered to the guidelines for making truly traditional boerewors. The Top 10 recipes were selected after a rigorous judging and tasting process. The finalists showcased their boerewors-making skills at the finale onÂ Wednesday.
