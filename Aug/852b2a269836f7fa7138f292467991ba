The Hout Bay teenager who went missing on Tuesday has been found, the local Community Policing Forum (CPF) said on Friday. The Hout Bay CPF said the15-year-old was found in the early hours of Friday and has been reunited with her parents. No other information was divulged. Earlier this week Leah's mother, Tamsin Hall, made a desperate plea on Facebook, saying: "Whoever has my child must please return her and I want her to know that we love her." At the time, Leah was last seen by her mother and grandmother at 3pm on Tuesday in Hout Bay. She had left home in a highly emotional state and her mother reported her missing on Wednesday. What added to her mother's anxiety was that Leah had left without taking her medication with her. The Pink Ladies Missing Children's Organisation assisted in the search for Leah and had distributed pamphlets. Leah was spotted at a flat in Green Point at around 3pm on Thursday, Netwerk24 reported. "By the time we got there she had already left. We drove around Green Point until late in the night, but eventually had to give up our seemingly fruitless hunt," said Tamsin. Tamsin gave her contact details to the security guard at the building where she had been spotted and told him to call her and keep Leah safe if she returned. She got a call just after midnight that Tamsin had been spotted. "She was very traumatised when we went to fetch her, but she came home with us and will have to receive counselling and get treatment to get her back on her feet again," said Tamsin, who thanked the people of Cape Town who helped search for her daughter.
