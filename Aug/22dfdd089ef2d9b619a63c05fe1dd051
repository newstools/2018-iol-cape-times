A parent who is owed maintenance can now approach the courts to attach these annuities even before the prescribed retirement date, according to the Wynberg Maintenance Court ruling last month Venessa Lees, who had approached the courts, has been hailed as the driving force behind the ruling. “I would like to commend the maintenance court in Wynberg and everyone who assisted in this process which, to my surprise included the Justice Department. who were with me every step of the way,” she said. Lees received a cheque for the attached policy during a press conference arranged by the Justice Department. It was a proud moment for the mother of two young boys after not receiving maintenance for more than a year. The Justice Department applauded single mothers who stand up for their children’s rights and appealed to all parents to approach the courts for help in the pursuit of justice. Through this process and her weekly visits to the court, Lees identified a need of many - mostly mothers - who often have to flee their homes in a hurry. These mothers required “survival packs” filled with basic toiletries, clothes, and similar items. To meet this need, she, with the support of TheKidz App, Office National and Pick * Pay have put out a call to donate worn backpacks and handbags with these essentials. Bags can be dropped at selected Pick * Pay stores and will be donated to the children’s court to help families in need. Additionally, in partnership with The Little Optimist author Greg Bertish, Lees and TheKidz have added bright murals to the Wynberg Maintenance Court to make children more comfortable when accompanying their parents. The Office National box can be found in the front of the store and TheKidz App will ensure that the bags are delivered. Cape Times
