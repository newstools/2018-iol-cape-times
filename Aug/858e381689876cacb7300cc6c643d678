The family of 13-year-old Michal Roux are still seeking answers after his suicide shocked the community of Stellenbosch this week. The Grade 7 Stellenbosch Primary pupil was rumoured to have killed himself because he wasn’t accepted at prestigious Boland school Paarl Roos Gimnasium next year, Netwerk24 reported. However, this has been dismissed as a factor by Stellenbosch Primary principal Hawkie de Villiers, who said Michal had without a doubt been accepted to start his high school career at Gimnasium next year. After she had dropped off her daughter at Rhenish Girls’ High, Michal’s mother, Ingrid, found him lying in the study of their Stellenbosch home with a gunshot wound to the head. He was declared dead at the scene. Daniel Kriel, a family friend and their spokesperson, said: "We accept that a lot of rumours are doing the rounds after the tragedy, but none of them are true." De Villiers refuted another rumour that Michal, considered a quite, bright and popular pupil, had been a victim of bullying at the school. "We often spoke to the pupils, especially the Grade 7 pupils, about bullying and what they should do if they were targeted," he said.
