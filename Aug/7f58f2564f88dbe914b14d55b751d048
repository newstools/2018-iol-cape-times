There is a low risk of load shedding being implemented over the "long weekend", Eskom said in an early-evening statement on Wednesday. According to Eskom, the risk of rotational load shedding over the long weekend is low because there is expected to be a drop in demand over this period. It vowed to keep its customers informed over this period on all media platforms should there be a system status change. Luckily for electricity consumers Eskom has had no need to implement load shedding this week. Eskom had indicated last week that there would be a high risk of load shedding until September 2. The power utility has requested that businesses and the public use power sparingly during this period. This comes days after acts of intimidation at several power stations. The two largest unions at Eskom have allegedly accepted a revised wage offer in principle, but have deadlocked with the power utility, which reportedly wants to charge their members for participating in an unlawful strike.
