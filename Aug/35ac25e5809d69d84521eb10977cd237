Port Elizabeth - The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein has dismissed an application by convicted wife killer Christopher Panayiotou, for leave to appeal against his life sentence. Panayiotou lodged the application three months ago against the sentence imposed by judge Dayalin Chetty in the Port Elizabeth High Court. The Supreme Court of Appeal made the order last week. “The application for leave to appeal is dismissed [as] there are no reasonable prospects of success and there is no other compelling reason why an appeal should be heard.” Panayiotou was convicted of the murder and orchestration of his school teacher wife’s death. He was subsequently sentenced to life behind bars in November last year. Jayde was kidnapped outside her Stelen Glen Complex in Kabega  Park and shot dead on the outskirts of KwaNobuhle in April 2015. His co-accused, Sinethemba Nenembe, also received a life sentence for the murder, plus an additional 15 years for robbery, while Zolani Sibeko was handed 15 years for conspiracy to commit murder.
