CPF spokesperson Cheslyn Steenberg said: “We want to bring national attention to gang shootings in our communities. Our people are tired of the gang violence and are saying we need to highlight our plight and get the ministers and the police to see what’s happening in our areas.” He added that Operation Thunder had been established in their areas last week after the communities decided to close Voortrekker Road, the main road in and out of Kensington, between Jakes Gerwel Drive and 4th Avenue to highlight the recent shootings and killings. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the circumstances surrounding a shooting in Dapper Street, Kensington, on Friday in which a 32-year-old woman was shot and fatally wounded were under investigation. “In a separate incident a wanted suspect was arrested for an attempted murder case by members attached to Operation Thunder in Kensington,” said Rwexana. Anyone with any information about the shootings is asked to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111. @SISONKE_MD  sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
