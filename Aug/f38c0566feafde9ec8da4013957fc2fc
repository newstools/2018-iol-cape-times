The vigilance of officers attached to the Western Cape Flying Squad landed three suspects behind bars at about 10am today. This was shortly after they robbed a woman of her valuables in Delft. The members were on patrol in Nyanga when they spotted a VW Jetta without registration plates. This raised suspicion and the driver was signalled to pull over. He refused and following a brief pursuit the vehicle stopped and the occupants made an attempt to flee, but were apprehended. It was established that the vehicle was hijacked by four suspects in Browns Farm, Nyanga, last week. A search of the vehicle led to the discovery of an unlicensed firearm without a serial number and ammunition, as well as a handbag taken from the victim in Delft. The officers also recovered a police reflector jacket in the boot of the vehicle. The three suspects, aged 27, 32 and 34, are expected to appear in Athlone Magistrateâ€™s Court later this week for the possession of a prohibited firearm, possession of a hijacked vehicle and stolen property, as well as armed robbery.
