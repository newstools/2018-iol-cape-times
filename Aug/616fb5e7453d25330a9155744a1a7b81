CAPE TOWN - Five suspected abalone poachers were arrested in two separate incidents on Friday morning, Western Cape police said. Officers on patrol in Fish Hoek pulled over a light delivery vehicle in the early hours of the morning. "The vehicle was stopped and one of the occupants was still in his diving gear. A search of the vehicle led to the discovery of 101 units of abalone," police said in a statement. In a separate "intelligence-driver operation", police searched a vehicle where they found several bags of abalone. The 34-year-old driver from Hout Bay was arrested. "Not far from there, a parked Audi was searched and more bags of abalone were found. The second suspect, a 27-year-old man from the Northern Cape was arrested." The suspects would appear in the Simon's Town and Cape Town magistrates courts once charged. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. African News Agency (ANA)
