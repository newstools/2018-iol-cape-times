Toyer Abrahams, 56, from Athlone, is the man people contact when they need to raise funds for anything. A musical has been made chronicling his life. He was instrumental in helping local boy bands The Boys, Limited Edition, Dejavu, Rendezvous and more. About 10 of the artists he worked with are now based overseas with their families. The musical chronicles Abrahams’s life from bus driver to a local star in entertainment, and where he is now. “It wasn’t easy going from bus driver to bright lights. I was rejected in many ways. I was not found fit to be in their shows until I made a breakthrough and made a decision I would help our local talent in our community,” Abrahams said. Producer and nephew Abdul Schroeder said he was doing the show now while his uncle was still alive. “The show is about giving him recognition for what he has done for people. I want him to be remembered while he is still alive because he is the reason many are living their dreams and standing on stages across the country and the world today,” Schroeder said. Now in a wheelchair with his leg amputated, it has not stopped Abrahams from making music in his home studio. Abrahams said he would take audiences back to when Tony Dee was at his best. “I can’t believe how I made it to this far after what I went through in my life,” he said. Schroeder will be playing the role of Toyer Abrahams. “He looks like me and I swear, when you close your eyes when he sings he sounds just like me,” said Abrahams. Nadia Isaacs will be playing the role of his ex-wife Zurenah, who was what Abrahams describes as the “backbone of my career”. The show will take place at the Joseph Stone Auditorium, on October 19, 20 and 21. Reserved tickets cost R150, while unreserved cost R120.
