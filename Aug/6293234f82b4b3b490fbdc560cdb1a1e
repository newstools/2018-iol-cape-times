“She was crying at the time she was relaying the story to the teacher,” said officer Siphiwe Siweya. Accused Aviwe Hoya is charged with kidnapping, robbing and raping five Khayelitsha pupils. The offences occurred between September 2011 and August 2012. State prosecutor Maria Marshall contends that the victims were on their way to or from school when Hoya ambushed them, threatened to stab them, and took them to an open field behind Esangweni High School in Kuyasa, Khayelitsha. He also allegedly raped one of the victims in a neighbour’s shack. Siweya said she received a call that the victim was raped and was at the Thuthuzela Centre in Khayelitsha. Siweya said the victim was on her way to school in the company of other girls when she saw a man chasing after her. They ran, but she slipped and fell behind. “He took her where there is no one. In this place there is a hole. He took off his jacket, put it on the grass, told the victim to lay on the jacket,” said Siweya. She said when he was done raping her, he accompanied her halfway to school before he disappeared. At her school, the victim relayed the story to a teacher. Her neighbour, Nomonde Fandleke, said the victim came to her home crying and she consoled her. Fandleke said she called her mother who took the victim to a rape centre. The trial continues today.
