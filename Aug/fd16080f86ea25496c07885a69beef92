 These Whales “holding hands” off the coast of Cape Town just goes to show how affectionate these gentle giants of the ocean really are. #lovecapetown #thisissouthafrica #fromwhereidrone A post shared by  MIKE ELOFF (@thelawry) on Jul 25, 2018 at 9:34am PDT It's whale season, and the waters around Hermanus are flaunting a whole lotta booty 🐋 we're not complaining 🙌🏻 . . 📸@davidpellicola #thisissouthafrica #sharesouthafrica #meetsouthafrica #hermanus #whalewatching #naturephotography #whale #ocean #travel #traveller A post shared by  Hotspots2c Tours (@hotspots2c) on Jul 24, 2018 at 7:10am PDT Oh, life! 🌊🐋 . . . . . #southernrightwhale #baby #calf #photography #nature #ocean #sea #blue #scubadivinggirls #scubadiving #freediving #beauty #tail #sardinerun2018 #bmsardinerun18 #desmitificandotiburones #instagood #like #follow #naturephotography A post shared by  Reii Credi (@reiicredi) on Aug 3, 2018 at 6:47am PDT June to October may be the low season in #CapeTown, but there’s never any want for things to do. One of the most exciting and celebratory events is the annual passing of #whales along the coastline of #SouthAfrica. There is something so magical about seeing these enormous creatures breaching, tail-slapping and blowing as they make their journey through the wonderous #ocean. Cape Town and its surrounds happen to be one of the best places to whale-watch, with thousands of visitors both locally and abroad joining in on the action each year. There is even a festival to honour the experience.
