A Stellenbosch wine farmer has been forced to return to court to obtain a second interdict to remove shacks from his land. The matter is expected to be heard on August 21. Last week people started building shacks on Watergang, which belongs to a family trust that includes the Louiesenhof wine estate. After an eviction order was granted in the Western Cape High Court on Saturday, the Red Ants eviction company dismantled the unoccupied shacks. In terms of the court order granted to the owners, only unoccupied shacks could be removed, and no more shacks could be built. More shacks were removed when people went to work. A total of 87 out of 400 structures were dismantled. Men, women and children were seen rebuilding their shacks in the rain and mud on Tuesday, News24 reported. Nandiswa Masimini said: "They promised to speak to us, but no one followed up. So we decided to bring our shacks and build here." "We don't have money to pay rent. Even our (original landlords) don't want us back because we have moved everything out already. We don't know where we're supposed to go."
