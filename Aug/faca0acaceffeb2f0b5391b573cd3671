WARNING: Pictures contain strong language. Cape Town - Hundreds of women and gender non-conforming people took to the streets of Cape Town on Wednesday for the #TotalShutdown march against gender-based violence. The group, most of them wearing wearing black with a touch of red, made their way to Parliament to hand over a 5-page memorandum with their 24 demands. And while protesters were vocal, their placards also spoke volumes.   IOL
