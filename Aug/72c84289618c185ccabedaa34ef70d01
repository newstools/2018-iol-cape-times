Police divers had no success in their search for missing fisherman Durick van Blerk in Hout Bay harbour on Wednesday. Van Blerk family spokesperson Roscoe Jacobs, a community activist, said the police divers would continue their search on Thursday, depending on the weather. The 26-year-old Van Blerk was on a late night fishing expedition on Friday when it's believed he was shot by police patrolling for poachers, before falling overboard. This triggered violent protests and arson on Sunday, with the protests continuing on Monday. His fellow fishermen were arrested and released on R1 000 bail when they appeared at the Wynberg Magistrate's court on Monday. The Van Blerk family spokesperson, Roscoe Jacobs, a community activist, said in a Facebook post on Wednesday night: "The Van Blerk family wishes to extend their gratitude to the police divers by thanking them for going out to search for their son. "The family wishes to thank the community for the support, in particular those who have heeded the call to end the unrest. Thank you to all the residents who came and supported the prayer services today. Another one is being arranged which will take place at night and will be made public once it's confirmed. "I would like to make a plea to everyone to stop the speculation as this is not assisting the situation and the family."
