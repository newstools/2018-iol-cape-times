Two people remain in a critical condition after a fatal bus crash between Aberdeen and Beaufort West in the Karoo on Thursday that claimed 10 lives. Thirty people were injured when the bus carrying 60 passengers is alleged to have struck an animal, with the driver losing control of the vehicle. Many people had to be extricated from under the wreckage. The accident took place at 2.15am, about 25km outside Beaufort West. Most of the injured have been discharged from hospital, the SABC reported. Investigations into the crash are continuing. The names of the victims have not been released. Transport MEC Donald Grant told News24 that his officials are going to have talks with the bus company, Naledi Coach Services, to assist in the investigation. The director of the bus company, Bennet Mateka, said he was very sorry for the loss of life, but that it was an accident no one had control over. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said “police are currently investigating a case of culpable homicide".
