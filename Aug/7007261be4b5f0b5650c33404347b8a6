The 56-year-old, who works at the Michael Mapongwana clinic’s maternity obstetrics unit (MOU), has been delivering babies and saving their lives for about 22 years. Even when she is off duty, the Khayelitsha mother of twins acts as a nurse for her community in Site C. As Women’s Month nears its end, the spotlight is on this respected and treasured nurse who goes the extra mile for her patients. “I have always loved people and caring for them. I was motivated by my mother and growing up in this community where sometimes ambulances arrive late. “I first just wanted to learn first aid so that I could help my family and community when desperate measures would need to be taken. “However when I finished my training I wanted more and pursued dreams of becoming a professional nurse,” said Ngxabani. "She said her job was tough and stressful at times, but because she had such a passion for it she often overlooked how hectic it could be. A favourite part of Ngxabani’s job is when she sees a healthy mother and baby again after the pair have been discharged. “To think about it, sometimes it’s scary because we can save a life or lose it. There is nothing that motivates me more than a happy and healthy mother. “Some will stop me in the street to show me how well her baby is growing,” Ngxabani said. About 120 babies are born every month at the clinic.
