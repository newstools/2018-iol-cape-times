This is my land and I will never be treated like a foreigner in my own land' " the leader of the red berets said. He said that the march was not about the dompas in isolation. "The Boers wanted to treat African people as if they are foreigners in South Africa and the women said 'no we're not foreigners here, this is our land, (Johannes G.) Strijdom take your dompas because we don't need it, we want free movement in our own land," says Malema. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. Politics Hub
