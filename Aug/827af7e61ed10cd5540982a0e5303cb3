Former Western Province Rugby Football Union (WPRFU) vice-president Gerald Njengele could face a civil lawsuit following an alleged racism incident. Njengele was initially found guilty by a disciplinary tribunal and suspended from all rugby activities for four years, before successfully appealing the verdict, News24 reported. But earlier this month he resigned from his post. "Vice-president of the Western Province Rugby Football Union, Mr Gerald Njengele, handed in his voluntary resignation. The resignation stems from the incident that took place at the HSBC Sevens in Cape Town last December and the internal disciplinary hearings which followed," a statement on wprugby.com said at the time. WPRFU president Thelo Wakefield had said: “Mr Njengele took the magnanimous decision this morning to resign in acknowledgement of the fact that no one person is greater than the union and that the name and reputation of WPRFU needs to be held in high esteem at all times." But Jessie Claassen, the person involved in the incident at last year's Cape Town Sevens, has threatened to initiate a civil lawsuit against Njengele. Njengele was accused of launching a verbal and racial attack on Claassen, who is the national manager of the Vuka Rugby Programme, which is a SA Rugby-affiliated initiative that aims to cater for rugby development in the country. In an interview with Netwerk24, Claassen revealed that he would start civil proceedings against Njengele if he did not receive an official apology. “He shows no remorse and there are no signs of him issuing any kind of apology for his actions,” said Claassen. Claassen earlier said the attack stemmed from his decision not to shake Njengele's hand due to a previous altercation between the pair last August. When this happened, Njengele allegedly responded: "F**k you white people, f**k the coloureds. I'm a clever darkie. I don't need your f*****g money."
