De Lille was joined by mayoral committee member Siyabulela Mamkeli and ward councillor Anthony Moses at the upgraded Anthony Road Park in Athlone. “This project demonstrates our commitment to providing communities with quality social amenities. For the 2018/19 financial year, Ward 44 has set aside nearly R500 000 to upgrade parks including in Luyoloville,” De Lille said. According to De Lille, many residents raised housing issues, particularly about their long wait on the housing database. “There are 36 housing developments which have been allocated a budget for the next three financial years and Heideveld is one of the areas to benefit from the R2.1billion investment. This project will accommodate the Heideveld Duinefontein housing development which has delivered 738 units,” De Lille said. Two shipping containers that will serve as office space were also donated by the city council to Women 4 Justice, a women-led organisation assisting residents with their needs and advocating for the safety of community members. De Lille said the pop-up office was about providing a face-to-face platform for residents to share their concerns as well as their ideas about how the city council could improve its services to the community. “Since the start of this innovative concept two months ago, we have visited various communities and have dealt with about 150 individual complaints ranging from housing queries to water billing and refuse collection,” she said. On Wednesday, De Lille hosted 130 women from shelters who left abusive relationships and were building new lives thanks to the Western Cape Women’s Shelter Network. “Walking away from an abusive relationship is a sign of strength. It shows the world that you know your worth and your rights,” De Lille said.
