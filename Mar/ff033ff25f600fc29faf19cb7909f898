The young bowler is currently suspended for the next two Test matches against Australia for brushing the shoulder of the visiting captain Steve Smith during the second Test at St George’s Park. Cricket South Africa are appealing the decision, but the 22-year-old is just trying to put it all behind him. “It is nice to have some quiet time, chill with family and friends, and get up to things that I normally would. "It has been a bit of a whirlwind, there has been a lot of talk, a lot of hype. "But that’s what happens occasionally, it comes with the game at certain times. "It was a big learning curve,” Rabada told Independent Media. South Africans have certainly been supportive of the world’s No 1 bowler, especially on social media, and this has not gone unnoticed. Rabada has taken 15 wickets at an average of 16.80 in the two Tests against Australia this month, with his raw pace and accuracy testing the quality of the visiting batsmen. “It has been great to feel the support; people have a keen interest. However, nothing changes. Things still remain the same "It’s debatable (whether he was harshly treated). Some people think so, some people don’t. I think I take responsibility for what happened. "On the video it looks like I got into the guy’s (Smith) space, so I shouldn’t have done that. "I’ll say 50/50 it’s my fault I didn’t feel anything in the moment.” It is not only the general public that have pledged their allegiance to Rabada. England fast bowler and former world No 1 James Anderson has been sympathetic, while Rabada’s teammate Vernon Philander originally tweeted that Smith was also at fault. Philander, however, later posted a message claiming his social media account was hacked.
