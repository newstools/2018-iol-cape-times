Cape Town- Six prisoners in Pollsmoor broke through their cells bars, windows and jumped at the back of the prison’s backyard before escaping, provincial Correctional Services department commissioner Delekile Klaas told the Cape Times. A case of escaping from custody was reported with the Kirstenbosch police station. The crimes vary from attempted murder, rape, violent assaults, robbery and housebreaking, one offender was serving a 12 year sentence. The six are still at large and members of the Emergency Support Team from Correctional Services working closely with the SAPS. The fence where the escaped prisoners jumped was “not electrified”. “This is a new fence that has just been installed,” said Klaas. He said the escaped inmates used maximum force to break the burglar bars and the window. The Department of Correctional Services has initiated an internal investigation into this incident.  Members of the public are urged not to try to engage the six, but rather report to the nearest police station.
