The pupils said they were tired of empty promises from the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) as they had been protesting for a new high school since 2015. “We are here today because we are tired of the school conditions which the WCED said it would fix two years back. "Our classes are shipping containers which are very hot in summer and we are overcrowded. In one class we are over 40. The learning environment is not conducive and we have to share the few textbooks,” said a Grade 12 pupil, Asanele Gedeni. Another pupil, Mihle Khiva, said they also wanted their principal to be removed. “Other schools have sport grounds and libraries, we have nothing. Every year during examinations, a hall has to be hired for the matrics to write. "Our principal doesn’t care about us,” said Khiva. When no one from Parliament would attend to them, they attempted to close the road and  police warned them about the illegal protest. The pupils left to occupy the provincial Department of Education offices. They were told their representatives would be taken for a tour of the site where the new school would be built. The department denied claims that pupils were learning from shipping containers and said they had prefabricated mobile classrooms. "The Department of Public Works has appointed a contractor to build the new Philippi High School following a tender process. The contractor will move on site on March 28,” said WCED spokesperson Paddy Attwell. He said the department had kept interested parties "fully aware of plans for the school" over the past year. “All parties agree that the school is overcrowded. The new school will relieve this. The current teacher: pupil ratio is 36.3:1, which exceeds the norm of 35:1 for high schools. "The norm for primary schools is 37:1. The department does not have budget to allocate additional teachers at this stage. Our district office will continue to advise the school.” Cape Times
