A special council meeting in Nelson Mandela Bay could not get under way on Thursday because of disruptions from opposition parties. Several motions were expected to be tabled including a motion to have Mayor Athol Trollip removed, but a scuffle broke out between Economic Freedom Fighter member Zilindile Vena and Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane. The tension soon diffused but opposition parties demanded that Maimane leave. Council Speaker Jonathan Lawack adjourned the special council meeting indefinitely and said there was clear intent from some councillors to disrupt the meeting.
