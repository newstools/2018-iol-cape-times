Fresh Air for Hout Bay (FAHB) has complained the emissions from the Lucky Star factory are a health hazard, even though the City last year  renewed its Atmospheric Emission Licence. FAHB representative Kiara Worth said it was to meet City officials, including mayco member for Safety and Security and Social Services, JP Smith to discuss the issue, but the meeting was cancelled. “FAHB remains concerned that the air emissions from Oceana have a negative impact on life in Hout Bay. At the same time, we recognise the need for socio-economic stability, primarily within disadvantaged groups. “We understand the factory cannot shutdown overnight due to the significant and real impact it would have on the broader community. FAHB has never advocated for the closure, but has instead advocated that the government needs to demonstrate it has a plan to resolve this situation: a harbour development plan that meets the socio-economic needs of local groups while addressing the concerns of residents regarding the air emissions,” Worth said. Smith said the ward councillor and senior environmental health official could not make the meeting as it had only been arranged on Tuesday. A group of people from the Hout Bay Civic Association on Thursday picketed in support of the factory.
