The NSRI rescue vehicle, NSRI medical crew with an NSRI trainee crew member who is a doctor, Private Care ambulance services, Kouga Fire and Rescue Services, and the South African Police Service responded," he said. "On arrival on the scene we found family members and bystanders and other surfers had recovered the 87-year-old local man from the water who had been surfing. "We believe he was surfing with his family members when he appeared to collapse unconscious in the water." Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) efforts were initiated, but after all efforts to resuscitate the man were exhausted he was declared dead, believed to be from natural causes.
