As part of the SPCA’s Day Zero drill, the organisation turned off its water supply for the entire day. Yesterday, SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham said the organisation’s premises can house up to 700 animals, including dogs, cats, horses, goats, pigs and other animals in First Road, Grassy Park. “Whether the challenges range from simple day-to-day tasks - such as the washing of hands, cleansing kennels in order to maintain high levels of hygiene, through to the most vital requirement of providing fresh drinking water to animals in our care - preparing for Day Zero in a real-life re-enactment will ensure each individual staff member is well prepared and equipped to handle the crisis should that day arrive," Abraham said. “One thing is for certain - without an independent water source, each and every SPCA staff members’ work will be made that much more difficult. “Energy that should be directed completely towards the animals’ needs will now be severely impacted by the water crisis as staff focus on collecting water instead of spending time with the animals. “Without sufficient water for cleaning there is a very real concern regarding disease outbreak among animals in quarantine, and with that the transfer of illness to staff. “Aside from the immediate concerns within our organisation, we also have to worry about the vast number of stray animals that will be desperate for water as the drought continues.” She said the SPCA could assist animals suffering through that crisis only with the public’s help.
