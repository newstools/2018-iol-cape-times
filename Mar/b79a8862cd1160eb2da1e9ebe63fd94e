In light of the listeriosis outbreak, mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said “there is no link”. “City health received notification that organophosphate was found in the bloodstream of the children,” Smith said. This was the same finding contained in the post-mortem reports. Friends Athule Makonzi, Kanyisa Mtamzeli and Mzingisi Gobecimele died hours apart and another friend, Athabile Simayile, who shared the meal, spent four days in Somerset Hospital. Athule’s elder sister, Pamela Makonzi, said she wasn’t aware the City had conducted an investigation. “We never heard from the City. We are not able to find closure until we know how the children died and who is taking responsibility,” she said. Mzingisi’s aunt, Nomsa Tikiteni, said when she thought of her nephew she felt hurt. The families have insisted that Smith should  apologise for his “racist” claim that drugs may have been the cause of death. Smith has repeatedly denied making the claim, saying he was relating information received from Langa police. However, SAPS spokesperson Noloyiso Rwaxana has denied Smith’s claim that the information came from their office. “It is false to say that the City or I issued a statement saying that the three had died of drugs. I never claimed that drugs were involved but relayed information that SAPS had indicated that ‘other substances’ were involved.” Smith instead accused the Cape Times of falsely claiming he had indicated drugs were to blame. Asked if they had informed the families about the outcome of the probe, he said: “City health staff engaged with the families during the investigation and they were informed that we had received notification that the cases were related to organophosphates.” Smith added that in terms of the environmental health investigation, the City cannot release the report.
