Salome Damon-Johansen is celebrating eight years drug-free and will share her story of being clean of methamphetamine (tik). “I did tik, cocaine and rock, but eight years ago I just decided to stop. I was in my early twenties when the drug addiction started and it lasted for about five years,” she said. Damon-Johansen said supporters had reached out to her with both positive and negative responses. “Somebody asked me how am I going to change the world by doing this, but honestly, if I can just change the mindset of one person then I have done what I wanted,” she said. The singer debuted her single, Keep It Together, last year. It was the second-highest climber on the Heart FM Top 40 this week, going from No 30 to No 6. Damon-Johansen said Rocklands High School would be a beneficiary of her show at 
Westend at 8.30pm today. It cost R100 each and can be bought at the door.
