During the gathering at the River Club in Observatory yesterday, World Wildlife Fund SA’s seafood market transformation manager, Chris Kastern, said increasing awareness and a growing sense of responsibility in the seafood industry led to a number of global initiatives to help address the challenges. “In order for there to be sustainability, the harvesting of the precious resource must be addressed, and the right people need to start talking to each other,” said Kastern. He said the failure to engage and create measures to address the issue resulted in the valuable resources being depleted. While the government held the ultimate responsibility for managing fisheries, supply-chain companies and retailers played a critical role in supporting best practice and reducing the opportunities for illegal fishing and non-compliance. MSC SA manager Michael Marriott said the fisheries 
sector realised there was a marked demand for certified products. “We have a chain of custody standard that ensures traceability of the certified product of a certified fishery. "In this way consumers can be sure the seafood they are buying comes from legal, well-managed fisheries,” said Marriot. Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry research resource directorate scientist Deon Durholtz said the sustainability and preservation of the precious resources was paramount.
