She has also asked for people to support not only her but other victims of sexual misconduct. “I also am aware of the distress his (Jordaan’s) family must be experiencing and express my sadness that they are inevitably affected,” Ferguson wrote on her Facebook timeline. She opened the case in Parkview in Johannesburg. The case was transferred to Port Elizabeth as the alleged incident happened there. Eastern Cape police spokesperson Priscilla Naidu yesterday confirmed that a case of rape was under investigation. She said the docket was still with the Joburg police and was yet to be transferred to the Eastern Cape. Asked if any arrests were imminent, Naidu said the investigation would determine that. Ferguson arrived in the country last week for a series of four emotive concerts called JENNIFER #WeToo as a creative response to the recent disclosure of her rape. She is scheduled to perform at the Baxter Concert Hall from April 4 to 7. Ferguson broke her silence last year, claiming Jordaan raped her at the Holiday Inn in Port Elizabeth in 1994. Attempts to reach Jordaan were unsuccessful on Sunday. In a statement, Jordaan’s lawyer Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi said: “Doctor Jordaan reiterates that the allegations made by Ms Jennifer Ferguson are false and the event to which she refers never happened. “Doctor Jordaan has further said that from the time that Ms Ferguson first made these allegations on social media, the legal system is the only forum in which Ms Ferguson’s version can be tested. “The court proceedings will allow him and the South African public the opportunity to get to the truth.”
