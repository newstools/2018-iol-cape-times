This came as the Justice and Correctional Services Department announced yesterday that the revised Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill had been approved by the cabinet on Wednesday. The pilot phase of the Zimele Racism Reporting app intends to aggregate data and provide a trend analysis of hot-spot areas where racism may be prevalent. The foundation’s spokesperson, Zaakirah Vadi, said it was fitting to launch the app in Anti-Racism Week. “Zimele Racism Reporting can be found on Play Store, but at this stage is only available for Android devices. The app is free and easy to use. "Another thing that is good about it is that as a victim, you can report an incident anonymously. If someone cannot use it, another person can report a incident on their behalf.” The foundation was well aware some people could lodge fake complaints, but cautioned that people who did so would not go unpunished. The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation collaborated with the Innovation Hub, Geekulcha and mLab. “If there is a school in a certain area where we are getting five reports from we know that there is something really serious going on at that school. We will then send in facilitators to resolve the issue. “At the moment we are in the pilot phase and trying to engage with a range of organisations that deal with racism problems, like the SA Human Rights Commission,” said Vadi. The department’s deputy minister, John Jeffery, said: “There is no question that incidents of racism and racial discrimination are all too frequent and we are confident that the bill, once passed, will contribute to eradicating not only racism, but all forms of discrimination.” After the bill was published in the Government Gazette for comment, 75854 submissions were received.
