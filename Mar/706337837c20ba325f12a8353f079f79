Cape Town - Forensic Pathology Services data shows 28 people were killed between February 28 to March 6 on Western Cape roads. Sixty-four percent (18) of these fatalities were pedestrians, and four were passengers. The Western Cape's Transport and Public Works Department on Thursday said the most recent incidents happened on Monday when a pedestrian was  killed in Cape Town, and another three pedestrians were killed in the Winelands/ Overberg Region. Director of provincial traffic law enforcement, Farrel Payne, said: "We are concerned at the number of pedestrians who were killed this week. This is in spite of the ongoing road safety education activities of our Directorate: Road Safety Management in schools and in communities. We strongly encourage pedestrians to wear visible clothing at night, and drivers to take extra care wherever pedestrians walk on and near our roads." Twelve arrests were made for offences including excessive speeding, and driving while under the influence of alcohol.
