“A case of murder was opened for investigation by Parow police following an incident at a home at Churchill Estate, Parow. According to reports, police attended to the complaint at the address, and upon arrival, they found the body of a 52-year-old man lying on the floor,” said police spokesperson FC van Wyk. Parow Community Policing Forum chairperson Roger Cannon said there had recently been a surge in crime in the area. Following the incident, residents took to social media expressing their shock and concern. Cannon said: “There has been a spike in aggravated robberies in the area and we have monthly meetings with the SAPS to report back. “There is not enough manpower at the station, and on some days we only have one police van patrolling the area. There is just not enough visibility. We have raised this with the cluster and provincial SAPS but it all comes down to funding,” Cannon said. According to information from the police, the victim was found by his daughter after he had not arrived at work since Wednesday. Police believe the killers gained access to the man's home through a window and allegedly stabbed him in the head.
