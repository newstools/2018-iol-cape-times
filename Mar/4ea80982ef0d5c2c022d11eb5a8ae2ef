Multiaward-winning “hot”, jazz pianist, electronic musician and writer Vijay Iyer - from the US - will join this year’s line-up. As part of its ongoing sustainable training and development programmes, the CTIJF  puts on a series of masterclasses each year. These free masterclasses are an ideal opportunity for anyone with an interest in music (of any genre), to learn from professional performers - to better their own shows or simply just to get up close and personal with some of the festival’s many top artists. Organisers say the CTIJF masterclasses have always been well subscribed, and this year they expect no different, with a stellar line-up of music masters who have agreed to share their stories and present their musical mind-food. This year’s talented stars include the British queen of soul and contemporary R&B song-writing, Corinne Bailey Rae (UK), who has secured multiple Top 10 UK and US albums and a stack of Grammy and MOBO Awards; Iyer;  and vocalist, upright bassist and composer-cum-arranger Miles Mosley (US), who will stand and deliver  on Friday. Banks will offer his indie pop, progressive jazz and Indo-jazz fusion knowledge; and trumpeter Nicholas Payton (US) - whose music fuses his home town New Orleans sound with modern jazz, hip hop, mixtape and spoken-word - will delve into what makes his music happen. On the same day,  Mulatu Astatke (Ethiopia), who is recognised for his unique blend of traditional Ethiopian music, Western jazz and Latin rhythms, will round out the masterclass offerings for this year. The masterclasses will take place at the VOC Room on the 3rd floor of the Cape Sun Hotel, at the following times: Friday, March 23 10-10.50am - Miles Mosley 11-11.50am - Vijay Iyer 12-13.15pm - Music business 13.30-14.30pm - Corinne Bailey Rae Saturday, March 24 10.30-11.15am - Louiz Banks 11.30am-12.15pm- Nicholas Payton 12.30-13.15pm - Maluta Atzuka Although free of charge, booking is essential.
