A police investigation is under way. The workers were laying stormwater pipes when the trench collapsed on them. Two men, believed to be aged between 30 and 40, died on the scene. Another man was seriously injured and airlifted to hospital in a Skymed Air Rescue helicopter. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said an inquest docket had been opened. Cape Medical Response (CMR) assisted with the extraction and treatment of the three workers. “CMR wishes to extend their condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the deceased,” it said. There was heavy traffic along Kommetjie Road because it had to be closed to allow the helicopter to airlift the 
injured worker to Groote Schuur hospital. Motorists had to use alternative routes. It is thought that the men worked for Martin and East. When the Cape Times called the office, a man who did not want to be named but identified himself as a manager, said they would consider releasing a statement about the incident today. “Unfortunately, we will not be able release a statement today, maybe tomorrow,” said the representative.
