“Dear Grade 9 learners and Lavender Hill High students, you guys lost a fellow learner today due to gang violence. "How many more kids need to die before this violence stops? "These (shootings) have a huge impact on the community because all of us are unsafe. We are constantly looking over our shoulders to see what’s happening.” The plea by a resident to a WhatsApp group followed the killing of Courtney Jackson, 16, of Sonata Street, Steenberg. His friend Yaseen Miller was wounded. No one has been arrested and police are investigating a case of murder and attempted murder, said police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana. “According to information, police responded to the complaint and upon their arrival, found the body of a 16-year-old male with gunshot wounds to his body. The other unidentified victim was shot and wounded. No one has been arrested.” Courtney’s cousin, Peter Gelant, said that according to witnesses, occupants of a white Nissan bakkie shot the boy at about 7.30pm. He had about six gunshot wounds. Gelant said after learning of the shooting, he took Courtney’s mother, Melanie van Nelson, to see him at Retreat Day Hospital, where staff tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate him. “When I spoke to Yaseen at the hospital, he said he did not see any faces, but he confirmed seeing the white Nissan 1400 bakkie with a canopy,” said Gelant.
