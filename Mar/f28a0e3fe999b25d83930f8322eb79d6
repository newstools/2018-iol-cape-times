The duo previously applied for bail but this was denied as magistrate Goolam Bawa said the acts  were “barbaric”. The state also indicated they would be revisiting two sexual assault cases against De Kock. Magistrate Goolam Bawa said: ““The accused (De Kock) has two previous convictions related to theft and drugs. He was also previously charged on two occasions for sexual assault on his own daughter. These cases were withdrawn and will now be revisited.” It was also confirmed that De Kock’s wife would be a state witness in the case. Charnelle was found wrapped in a plastic bag and a curtain. DNA testing revealed semen traces found on her pants. At the previous court appearance, the State detailed that both accused were watching pornographic videos the day of Charnelle’s disappearance. The material has been seized by the police as part of the ongoing investigation.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
