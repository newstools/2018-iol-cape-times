Johannesburg - A class action lawsuit
was filed on Thursday against Tiger Brands, one
of whose food factories has been linked to a listeria outbreak
that has killed 180 people since early 2017, the lawyer running
the case said. Richard Spoor, a human rights advocate who masterminded a
massive class action on behalf of gold miners with silicosis,
said the case against Tiger Brands was clear. "Their
fingerprints are all over this outbreak," he told Reuters. A spokeswoman for Tiger Brands confirmed the company had
received the filing and was reviewing its contents.
