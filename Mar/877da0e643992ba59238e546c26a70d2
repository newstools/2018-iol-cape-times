The unemployed Nyameka Tywala, 53, sustained severe burn wounds on her hands, face and back and was rushed to hospital. Linamandla Tywala, 14, Sinothando Tywala, 11, and 7-year-old Someleze Tywala were sleeping when the fire broke out. Neighbours told the Cape Times they suspected the fire started as a result of a faulty electricity box. One neighbour, Nobuntu Gwangqa, said she was woken by people shouting that the house was on fire. She and other neighbours rescued the grandmother from the burning shack. “The flames were too big. The grandmother was lucky she was saved,” said Gwangqa. “We realised that the children were trapped inside the house after saving the grandmother, when we asked after the children’s whereabouts. “To lose children in such a manner is very painful. ‘‘No one was working in that home. Any help of anything would be greatly appreciated,” she said. When the Cape Times visited the scene about 20 neighbours were busy helping to rebuild the shack.    “The least we can do is rebuild the home so that the grandmother has a place to stay when she comes back,” said Gwangqa. Another community leader, Alime Klaas, said: “The grandmother sold fruit and vegetables for survival. “With the money from that she will not be able to bury her grandchildren.’’ In some instances such fires are started when someone tries to cook, falls asleep and leaves the stove unattended, but this was not the case here. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest docket had been opened for investigation. Cape Times
