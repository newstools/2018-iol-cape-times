Ferguson’s concerts are a creative response to the disclosure of her rape. The show follows on the heels of her opening performance at The Forgotten Angle Theatre Collaborative’s (FATC) My Body My Space: Public Arts Festival (MBMS). “I want to go beyond the personal #MeToo to a universal #WeToo,” she said. The concerts will feature the joyful and the introspective. “It’s a song-communion of a kind for all of us who have been hurt, somewhere, sometime men and women. "So hopefully we can rise again with a matured vision of a more courageous and authentic life. After the storm we rise and sing again Together,” said Ferguson. “JENNIFER could be you or me. My story is just one of tens of thousands. We need to look at other ways of dealing with the culture of sexual violence and admit the judicial system is failing too many of us." She said narrative justice offered something different as a path to healing the individual and the community. “I hope that this sharing of song and stories, will empower us to speak our truth, restore societal balance and heal." JENNIFER #WeToo will feature special guest artists Zolani Mahola and Tina Schouw, both whom have been activists in their own right. Some of Cape Town’s best musicians are to accompany Ferguson.
