Spectators can look forward to two- and four-wheeled action taking place all weekend. The show will span the length and breadth of the Sun GrandWest Entertainment World, including the Market Hall, Grand Arena, the Sun Exhibits Hall and an outdoor area, and will include a Drifting Zone, Nostalgia Zone, Chill Zone, and Camping and 4x4 area. Visitors can get up close and personal with all the newest vehicle models that will soon be at dealerships around the country. To top it off, one lucky visitor will leave the show with their own Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Five trucks will  arrive from Gauteng and donate 100 000 litres of water to charities. Cape Town is experiencing its worst drought and Level 6B water restrictions have been imposed. Each person is restricted to 50 litres of water a person a day, putting great strain on organisations such as animal welfare, and those caring for children and the elderly. Sarita Gerber, managing director of Orliflex, said: “In November we organised a prostate cancer awareness convoy of trucks, during which we raised funds for prostate cancer research, so when we arranged to send trucks to CTMS, it seemed an obvious opportunity to assist Cape Town to receive much-needed water. “We have been inundated with donations from schools and businesses in Pretoria and on the East Rand, and we are now looking forward to safe delivery of water to the CTMS (today).”
