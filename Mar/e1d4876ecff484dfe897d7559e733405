Michelle Koopman said her Jack Russell went missing from a house in 34th Avenue Elsies River on 
Monday. “He was my therapy dog, my everything. He helped me through many years of pain and depression," she said. ‘‘Before I met Cashew I was at a very low point in my life - he changed that. We are very close. “He is very special. He is friendly, energetic and intelligent. He understands English. He was trained and loved by all.” Koopman said since Cashew's disappearance she was struggling to eat and sleep. She had walked the streets of Elsies River since Monday in search of him. “I went from street to street, door to door, asking, handing out flyers. "Many people sympathised with me and started walking with me to help me look. Many offered me hugs and cried with me. "I walked the streets of Clarke Estate and many came out of their flats to listen and even warned me to leave before they start shooting. “The people of Elsies River really showed up and are still looking for my child. They have been very supportive and I am deeply touched.” Cashew lived with Koopman’s friend’s mother in Elsies River on weekdays and with her in Ravensmead over weekends. “I could not leave him alone during the day and their house has high gates and two bigger dogs to protect him," she said. "The old lady’s husband also passed away last year, so Cashew gave her all the love she needed and he got all the love and attention he needed from her.” Koopman said she could not put a price tag on her dog.
