The National Freedom Party (NFP) on Tuesday urged beleaguered South African soccer boss Danny Jordaan to resign amid allegations of rape against him by former ANC MP Jennifer Ferguson. Ferguson alleged in October last year ago that Jordaan raped her at a Nelson Mandela Bay hotel room 25 years ago. She laid a charge of rape against Jordaan last week at Johannesburg's Parkview police station. The NFP said Jordaan has 10 days to vacate his top post at the SA Football Association (SAFA). "NFP calls for the immediate resignation of Danny Jordan, as we believe that football is one of the sport codes in the country used to attract and encourage many of our youth to become positive contributors of change. "Danny Jordaan must be given enough time to prove his innocence as an individual, not as Safa president," the party said in a statement.

Jordaan, a former mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay, has denied that the incident happened and has insisted that he is innocent. Last year, he denied Ferguson's offer of mediation between the two as it ran the risk of the public perceiving ''that there is a cover up away from the glare of public scrutiny".
