The foundation’s trustee and founder, Anthula Markovitz, said: “The sport is expensive. Fund-raising is important because we have many talented kids who would never have the opportunity because they don’t have the money. “You have to be really good to make it. Without sponsorship and help along the way, many kids fall along the wayside.” Markovitz said the foundation raised funds to help with travel to tournaments, equipment 
and to put young players through the Anthony Harris Tennis Academy, where they receive coaching to enable them to advance their careers. Recipients of all ages, ethnicity and backgrounds are scouted from across the country and the continent. “With proper investment, they can reach the top 100 to 150 and start earning prize money. “There is nobody (South African) in the top 20 other than Kevin Anderson, but there are talented kids here. They just need to be nurtured and given an opportunity to get to the top.” The fund-raiser will be hosted in Camps Bay by Gloria and Rolf Theiler, from Switzerland, at 6.30pm tomorrow. It is expected to be the foundation’s biggest charity dinner yet. Helene Budliger Artieda, the Swiss ambassador to South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia and Swaziland, along with her husband and sporting celebrities Jean de Villiers and Ryk Neethling, will also attend, among others. Jazz musician Ian Smith will perform with his band and guests can also look forward to entertainment surprises. Nine packages will be on auction at the event. Limited tickets are still available at R5 000 per person. For tickets or more information, Markovitz can be contacted at 083 500 0600.
