A moment of silence was held at the Langa cemetery, where four massacre victims are buried, before Struggle songs were sang. They then went to Robert Sobukwe Square where various speakers spoke about land restitution without compensation, free education, #FeesMustFall campaigns and uniting the party within. However, the commemorative event was not incident-free. Two factions commemorated the event, with each having separate programmes 200m apart to remember what transpired in Sharpeville in March 1960, when 69 people were killed and more than 180 were wounded. PAC veterans who were part of the planning and execution of the events leading up to the Langa massacre commemorated the day and encouraged young people not to let the party die. Robben Island prisoner Kwedi Mkalipi urged students aligned to Pasma, a student wing of the PAC, to open branches in their communities. “It can’t be right that we would be the last generation of the party. The young ones should take where we left off.” Pasma provincial deputy chairperson Songezo Booi said the PAC’s decline in support “was because of us”. “In this dilemma, factionalism, we find ourselves as PAC, is unconstitutional, anti-progress and anti-revolution. Factionalism is our main problem for the last 20 years, hence the party is in the state of stagnation. We want unity based on disciplinary action,” he said. Booi said it was time the youth infiltrated the party’s national leadership so they could share their views. “We must challenge these old people in the party. Once we are elected in the leadership we will force the party to have programmes, relevant programmes that address the challenges young people face.” National spokesperson Manelisi Mampane said the Langa and Sharpeville massacres were the most “horrendous responses of the apartheid regime to the demands of the Africans for the right for self-determination”.
