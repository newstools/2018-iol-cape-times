The Western Cape Department of Social Development (DSD) has completely suspended operations at its Gugulethu local office.  In a statement Social Development MEC Albert Fritz said ongoing tensions in the area posed a serious risk to staff safety, and necessitated their action.  Four vehicles belonging to staff burnt, and two government vehicles used by social workers were damaged this week during a protest over housing.  "We have come to learn that one of our social workers returning from fieldwork and unaware of the violence at the office, was accosted by the mob and ejected from the official vehicle. This vehicle was then burnt to a cinder. This matter has also been reported to the South African Police Services. "The two social workers are receiving trauma counselling after they were forced to barricade themselves in the building – along with a child in their care - as rampaging protesters tried to access the main office building," Fritz said.
