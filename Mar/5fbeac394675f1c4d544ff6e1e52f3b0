After seven months at sea, the six women are coming from Port Stanley in the Falklands, in what is the third leg of their maiden voyage. Local yachts were due to welcome the INSV Tarini’s arrival in Table Bay at about 7.30am, after which the crew was to dock at the Two Oceans Aquarium in the V&A Waterfront’s North Wharf. They will be moored at the Royal Cape Yacht Club until their departure on March 14. They were flagged off by India’s defence Mmer, also a woman, from Goa on board the 17m sailing vessel in September. The boat is skippered by Lieutenant-Commander Vartika Joshi and the crew members are Lieutenant-Commander Pratibha Jamwal, Lieutenant Aishwarya Boddapati, Lieutenant Patarapalli Swathi, Lieutenant Shougrakpam Vijaya Devi and Lieutenant Payal Gupta. Joshi sailed from Rio de Janeiro to Cape Town in 2014 and from Port Blair - Vizag - Chennai - Kochi on-board Mhadei.
