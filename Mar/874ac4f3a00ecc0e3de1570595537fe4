This despite DNA samples of sperm collected at the scene being found to be from Themba Nasi. Nasi and co-accused Phewe Ndlazelwana face three charges of rape and charges of attempted murder, assault with intention to do grievous bodily harm, sexual assault, housebreaking, pointing a firearm and illegally possessing a firearm, among others. The two appeared at the Parow Regional Court yesterday. The State claims the men entered a shack in Mango Street, Delft South, in April 2015 and raped three women and robbed them of three cellphones and R450. The victims, who all testified in the matter, said they were held at gunpoint in their shack while the accused robbed them. Nasi, represented by advocate Kenneth Roberts, denied the three rape charges against him. By instruction of his client, Roberts said: “My client denied during testimony, and still denies, he was present (at the address where the rapes occurred). “He doesn’t know how his DNA got on the scene and said he was only walking in the street that day.” State prosecutor Yolanda Pretorius argued that both accused carried out the crimes with common purpose. However, Carmelita Samuels, representing Ndlazelwana, said her client disputed he was  “the other person in the (shack)”. “The observation by witnesses and reliability of identification is being disputed.” National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the accused “terrorised the community of Delft as they broke into people’s shacks, held them up, robbed them and raped the women”. Due to time constraints, Magistrate Amanda van Leeve could not hand down judgment yesterday. The matter was postponed to  March 28 for judgment.
