So said Giant Pumpkin Festival organiser Michael Amos. The festival, taking in place in Heidelberg on March 24, has attracted farmers from around the country to compete. The biggest pumpkin will win R15 000. If the South African record, held by Hugo le Roux since March last year with a pumpkin weighing 556kg, is broken, the grower will win R30 000. Participants whose pumpkins weigh over 750kg can win R60 000. “I knew my pumpkin was heavy, but I didn’t expect it to be this heavy. There is a secret as to how I got it this big, but the secret is all mine,” said last year’s winner, Corné van Greu-
nen. His pumpkin weighed in at a massive 519.5kg. “I have participated in this competition for the past five years, but have only once had my pumpkin weighed in the final. It is too easy to make a mistake with these big pumpkins, such as giving it too much water, and then it rots.” Van Greunen was followed by Jaco Uys, who was awarded second place with his 387.5kg pumpkin, with Louwrens van Deventer, the previous year’s champion, finishing in third place with a 385.5kg pumpkin. Van Deventer scooped up first prize in 2016 for the largest pumpkin with a weight of 373kg. In second place was Van Deventer’s wife Theresa with a pumpkin weighing 354.5kg Amos said it took about nine months to raise a giant pumpkin. He said farmers would import special seeds, which should be planted around October. The seeds may cost between R200 and R1 000 each, depending on their rarity. Once the grower had prepared the soil, they would need to give the plant water and lots of love. By the beginning of January the plant will start showing signs of life. Amos said the festival donates funds raised to charity, local schools and old-age homes. It will also host a golf day, a mountain bike race, a running race and an ox braai with live music. During the day there will be events for children, and a  campsite will be available at the showgrounds. Cape Times
