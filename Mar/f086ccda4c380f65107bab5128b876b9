Johannesburg - The acceleration of expropriating land without compensation should be done within the law, says ANC secretary general Ace Magashule. Magashule, who was addressing the media on Thursday, said those who decide to embark on "land grabs" by illegally occupying land, should be arrested. In a rare move on Tuesday, the ANC supported the EFF's motion of expropriation of land without compensation. But the party made a few changes to the EFF's motion and called on the government to make use of options and ensure that land expropriation can happen with the protection of agriculture and food security. Another addition the ANC made was tasking the constitutional review committee to look at the possibility of reviewing the property clause in the Constitution. The committee has been given until August to give feedback on consultations.

The party had as recent as last year voted against the same motion when it was tabled in Parliament by the EFF. Mbalula said the party had no choice but to vote against the land expropriation motion last year because the party had not yet held its conference and had no mandate. "We spoke about willing seller and willing buyer, now we are at the point where we have to accelerate," said Mbalula. "It's a victory for the people of South Africa. The land audit shows we have not tempered with land distribution to a point where people can say land has been brought back," he said. Political Bureau
