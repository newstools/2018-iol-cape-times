The 13-year-old went missing from her home on March10 last year when she went to a shop a few doors from her house. Her body was discovered in a neighbour’s shed on March 21. She had been helping her mother take washing from the line when she asked to go to the shop to buy chips. Activist and founder of Philisa Abafazi Bethu, Lucinda Evans, said: “What an emotion-loaded day we had. I couldn’t contain my tears. "This is the day which shocked us and left us heartbroken. It is also the day we learnt, as the community, to support and stand united. "This beautiful child gave birth to my organisation and me as a woman leader.” The memorial service at the weekend was held at Levana Primary, where René went to school. Among those who attended were the families of Stacha Arendse - an 11-year-old who disappeared on March 27 last year while watching movies at a friend’s home in Matroosberg Street, Tafelsig. The next day, her naked and battered body was found in a field on Swartklip Road. “Two campaigns, #YourChildIsMyChid and #1Child2Many, were launched," said Evans. "We had an inclusive candle-lighting ceremony and opened the floor to speak 
about the importance of child protection in our communities. "I pledged my commitment to protect every child who crosses my path, and ensure we put extra pressure if there is a delay when a child has been violated.” Evans aid she was grateful for the opportunity, and thankful to the youth of Hanover Park, the class friends of René, and their partners Rotary and Powafix. René’s uncle, Stephen de Villiers, a member of the newly established René 
Roman search and rescue team, said the family were in a bad state. He said the day was not just to celebrate René but also to create child protection awareness in the community. The accused, Andrew Goliath Plaatjies, 50, who allegedly raped and killed René, is expected to appear at the Western Cape High Court on March 23. Cape Times
