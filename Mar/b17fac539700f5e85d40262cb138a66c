The protest on Tuesday started when more than 50 homes were razed on Sunday. The Gugulethu backyarders, who had been erecting their shacks on vacant land along Steve Biko Drive for about two weeks now, watched helplessly as their homes 
were demolished.   On Tuesday, journalists were prohibited from attending the backyarders’ meeting, after which the backyarders pelted the police with rocks. Buildings were damaged and vandalised, and a car was set alight in NY 108. The N2 was temporarily closed to traffic, said the city council’s Maxine Jordaan. The protesters stormed the offices of the Department of Social Development in the suburb and disrupted services. MEC of Social Development, Albert Fritz, said four cars belonging to staff were set alight and two government vehicles were damaged. “Two social workers were forced to hide in the building with a child who was in their care, as rampaging protesters tried to enter the main office building,” said Fritz. He said the actions of the protesters “were nothing short of criminality”, and staff was grateful the police responded swiftly. The backyarders said they were frustrated by the government’s slow pace to provide housing or land to build shacks. The protest came less than a week after mayor Patricia de Lille brokered a truce with the backyarders on Thursday. De Lille’s spokesperson Xolani Koyana said De Lille met with the backyarders and told them “she cannot give permission for them to settle on any of the land” . “The mayor committed that the city council would conduct an investigation on the portions of land in question,” he said. Koyana said: “the structures were erected illegally on the city council’s vacant portions of land without the city council’s approval”. “The city council had to take action before they were occupied,” Koyana said.
