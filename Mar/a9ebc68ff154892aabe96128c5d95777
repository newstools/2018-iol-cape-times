Hilton Levendal and his partner Maria Herbersdal were allegedly assaulted by the farm owner on February 25 while they were collecting wood at a nearby river. The Independent Civic Organisation of SA (Icosa) provincial leader Dawid Kamfer said the farmer was arrested on Sunday. “This came to our attention last week. We went to the police to find that while Hilton’s name was on record, no case had been opened. This man assaulted his partner at the river, before coming to their home and driving his tractor into it, destroying their home and injuring both residents,” said Kamfer. He said that he had to contact the cluster commander who immediately queried the matter, which led to the arrest of the farmer. “He has been trying to evict Hilton and his family from his farm for about a year now and had been victimising them consistently. When a farm owner is attacked, there is national outcry but not when farm labourers and dwellers suffer at their hands. “There is only silence,” said Kamfer. He said the farmer was in custody as the police had not completed their investigation and Icosa would consult an advocate as they would oppose his bail. Police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie said: “The suspect drove several times into the house of the complainant with the use of a tractor, where the complainant suffered minor injuries and initially only an assault case was opened. “He faces several complaints including 
assault, assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm and the illegal possession of 
firearms after four firearms were confiscated from his property.” He said members of the KwaNonQaba police station arrested the suspect on Sunday and he investigations continue.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
