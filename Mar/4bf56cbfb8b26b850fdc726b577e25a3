Lynne Manson Kullin was cycling from the Fish Hoek main road to Clovelly’s golf course on Saturday morning when the incident took place. Kullin said she usually cycled at Silvermine Nature Reserve but changed her route due to the spike in robbery incidents in recent months. “On Saturday morning, I was riding down a track close to the SANPark offices when it happened. A man jumped out at me with a knife and I couldn’t turn around fast enough. He cut off the backpack I had money in, searched through it and threw it on the ground. He also took my cellphone before grabbing my bike and walking off. “I just started running in the opposite direction to get to safety,” she said. Kullin said she had never heard of any other robberies along this route - until she posted about her incident on social media. “I would have never cycled there alone, had I known that there were also robbery incidents. I especially cycled this route because I used to cycle at Silvermine and decided to change to Clovelly to be safer.” Kullin reported the incident to police, but said she did not provide an identikit at the time. “I reported the incident to police immediately after I was assisted by a man who was walking his dogs in the area. “At the police station I was shown a series of mugshots but none of them was the guy who attacked me,” she said. Kullin said the suspect was “not hooded and had bloodshot eyes”. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a robbery case was being investigated.
