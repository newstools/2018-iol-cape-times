Marked annually from March 11 until 17, the World Glaucoma Week aims to create and prevention of the disease. The free eye screening tests were provided at Liberty Promenade Mall in Mitchells Plain. Lofob PR officer Heid Volkwijn said: “Optometrists caution that vision loss from glaucoma is silent, slow, progressive and irreversible if not detected in its early stages. “Although damage caused cannot be repaired with early detection and regular observation and treatment, damage caused can be kept to a minimum and good eyesight can be enjoyed indefinitely. " She said research showed that 75% of blindness could be prevented with early 
detection. “Glaucoma is ranked as one of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide and can affect anyone ranging (in age) from babies to those in their senior years. "We are very grateful as an organisation for the partnership with Torga Optical for offering the free eye screening, because eye examinations are key to 
saving sight.” Torga Optical optometrist Ridge Putter said they were able to accommodate about 30 people per day in their free examinations, and that they found certain eye diseases to be constant among Mitchells Plain residents. “Of all the eye diseases we have tested (so far) cataracts made up about 53%, and is a relatively easy intervention. Of the sight-threatening conditions our examinations revealed that about 28% of the people we tested had glaucoma,” said Putter. “Twelve-and-a-half percent retinopathy incidents were found - that is as a result of diabetes. "All of these conditions are painless. That’s why people get complacent after the initial diagnosis. "Cataracts can be premature if you spend a lot of time out in the sun without adequate eye protection,” he added.
