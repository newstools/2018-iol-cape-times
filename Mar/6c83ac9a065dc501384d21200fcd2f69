Cape Town â€“ Sixteen people were injured in a multiple-vehicle collision on the Schaapkraal Road in Grassy Park on Sunday afternoon, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics, along with Metro and Life Healthcare paramedics, arrived on the scene to find that four cars and a minibus taxi had collided, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. All the vehicles were found in the middle of the road, with the occupants walking around on the scene. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that a total of 16 had sustained injuries ranging from minor to serious. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the seriously injured with pain-relief medication before they were transported by various services to nearby hospitals for further treatment. Bystanders explained on the scene that smoke from a nearby veld fire may have contributed to poor visibility shortly before the collision, Meiring said. African News Agency (ANA)
