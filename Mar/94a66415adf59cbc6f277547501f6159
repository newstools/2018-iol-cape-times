Affectionately referred to as “Africa’s Grandest Gathering”, the CTIJF  is the largest music event in sub-Saharan Africa. The festival boasts multiple stages with over 40 artists performing over two nights. This year’s line-up includes acts such as Amanda Black from Port Elizabeth, Blinky Bill & Sibot’s Afrofunk Spaceship from Kenya and South Africa, Claire Phillips, Alistair Izobell, headline act Corinne Bailey Rae from the UK and the espYOUNGLEGEND 2018 winner, Jarrad Ricketts. The festival expects to host more than 34 000 music lovers and is combined with the CTIJF Sustainable Training and Development programme. CTIJF director Billy Domingo said the 19th edition of the festival will introduce a new cashless payment system. This simple tap-and-go solution will allow festival-goers to spend more time enjoying the acts, and less time standing in queues for food and drink. Domingo said: “The CTIJF has always been about putting our festival-goer at the heart of the event. Whether this is listening to the requests for artists, or the need for a more convenient digital payment system that negates the need to carry cash.” This year, the late South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela will be honoured with a special tribute which his son and American television host, Selema “Sal” Masekela, will attend. The City has asked motorists to plan their travelling around the CBD accordingly as there will be road closures from this morning until Sunday. Tickets are available on www.computicket.com, Computicket outlets and Shoprite Checkers outlets. * Capetonian Akhona Mapundu has been announced winner of the VIP ticket competition worth R12 000. The festival starts at 6.45pm.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
