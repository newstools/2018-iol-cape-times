The couple came under fire while in their driveway after visiting a family in Crossroads. No one has been arrested. Depouche, 50, was an ANC councillor for ward 36 between 1996 and 2016. He lost his seat after an internal party disciplinary hearing found him guilty of a 2013 incident of pointing a firearm at an elderly resident. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a murder and attempted murder case was being investigated. Rwexana said Depouche and Nobuntu were in their premises inside their car when two men approached them and fired several shots. Rwexana said both victims were transported to hospital for medical treatment. Depouch died due to his injuries. The family spokesperson Yonki Rasayi said the shooting “was not a robbery but a hit”. “Nothing was taken from him, he was targeted,” he said. “There were people who wanted him dead last year,” Rasayi said. SA Communist Party spokesperson Zuko Mndayi said Depouche woud be remembered for a “lifelong legacy of dedication to the liberation of the people of South Africa”. Cape Times
