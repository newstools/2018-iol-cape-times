Herbertsdale farmworker Hilton Levendal is relieved that the farmer who allegedly attempted to demolish his home by driving his tractor into it several times will spend another week behind bars. Frik Muller appeared at the Mossel Bay Magistrate’s Court yesterday following his arrest for allegedly assaulting Levendal and his wife Maria, and the destruction of their home. On February 25, Muller allegedly drove his tractor into Levendal’s family home, causing the roof to collapse and injuring Levandal. According to police, Muller faced several complaints, including assault, assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm and the illegal possession of firearms after four were confiscated from his property. Levendal said his and Muller’s relationship began to sour late last year after he stood up against the owner’s behaviour towards his workers. “He fired me and told me to f*** off his farm. This man has made it difficult for me to get work because the other farmers were told I’m a troublemaker,” said Levendal. “Our neighbours give us water in secret, because he would retaliate against them. Things are very difficult but I have to be strong for my family and I go off by myself and cry because I feel so hopeless.” He said he had hoped Muller would be denied bail as he had been warned by other workers, and even farmers, about what might happen to him if he were to be released. The Independent Civic Organisation of SA became involved when it heard of the incident, putting pressure on the police, leading to Muller’s arrest on March 3. Provincial leader Dawid Kamfer said the organisation was proud of those who supported the Levendals in court yesterday.
