They said the water would be drawn from restriction-free Swellendam, an area not experiencing the Western Cape drought. Last month, organisers vowed to draw zero litres of drinking water from the municipal supply at the event on Sunday. Director David Bellairs said the CTCTT had been working closely with the City around the mechanics of how this water would be introduced back into the municipal reticulation system. “We are extremely grateful to Swellendam municipality,, its municipal manager Anton Groenewald and Mayor Nico Myburgh for their generous offer of 2.2 million litres of potable water,” Bellairs said. “Our hydration partners, Coca Cola Peninsula Beverages, have committed to providing the transport solution from Swellendam to Cape Town. This is a mammoth undertaking - expected to take upwards of two weeks - and which could not be achieved w ithout their specialist assistance.” The additional provision of water, which takes the Cycle Tour water contribution to over 3 million litres, has been part of a private donation that has been added to the Steenbras Dam supply. Responding to the motivation for their donation Myburgh said: “Swellendam municipality, independently rated as the number one municipality in South Africa, has been the proud host of 
the prestigious Coronation Double Century for the past 10 years”. “Through this event, the Cape Town Cycle Tour Trust and its partners provide an annual economic injection of over R15m to the town of Swellendam and surrounds. So when the call came out recently that the Cycle Tour would offset the water consumption of 15 000 visitors by sourcing water from a non-drought stricken area, we immediately responded.” Cape Times
