The Land For Living march, organised by four civil rights groups to commemorate Human Rights Day, was also a show of solidarity for those activists who lost their lives. Activists from the Social Justice Coalition (SJC), Reclaim the City, the District Six Working Committee and Ndifuna Ukwazi demanded that the government take bold steps “to break with the past” and advance the human rights of the residents.    The demonstrators had placards and posters reading “Land for living” and “Children need safe homes”, while others chanted “Give us our land”. SJC general secretary Axolile Notywala said: “It is 24 years into democracy, but we are still fighting for our rights. The City, provincial and national government have failed us. “The national government must immediately publish the Rental Housing Amendment Act regulations and ensure that the minister regulates increases to keep rents affordable.” Salie Davids from the District Six Working Committee said dispossession persisted in the legacy of apartheid spatial planning and was evident in informal settlements, the inner city and “relocation camps”. The organisations said many of the challenges faced by informal settlement residents could not be separated from inner-city land, housing and eviction struggles. They believed that providing land and social housing in inner cities could allow for some people living in informal settlements and backyards to be provided for, as well as simultaneously de-densify many of the informal settlements on the periphery of Cape Town. Transport and urban development mayco member Brett Herron received and signed the memorandum at the Civic Centre. “I agree that government needs to do more about access to better-located housing and land tenure. Our challenge is as much about funds as it is about land. I’m willing to engage with any organisation in an effort to address what I regard as one of our greatest challenges - our housing deficit.” Cape Times
