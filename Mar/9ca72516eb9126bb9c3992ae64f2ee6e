The Western Cape Education Department had confirmed it was in possession of pictures and videos showing the staff member allegedly engaging in sexual activities with pupils of Fairmount Secondary School, situated in Parkwood, and other pupils from another Grassy Park high school. A police source confirmed they were able to view the footage but did not have it in their possession. “No case has been brought to police yet but after being able to view the footage and pictures, one can clearly see the staff member’s face.  “It would seem the acts were consensual but that cannot be confirmed,” the source said. The department had launched an investigation into the matter after it went viral on Twitter. The staffer has since been suspended. Of the pictures posted on Twitter, the staffer can be seen kissing a pupil, in another he can be seen holding the private parts of a pupil. Other pictures show half-naked pupils posing in what looks like a school office. Social media users called for the staff member to be jailed. The allegations were exposed via a Twitter user last week, urging the school to take action. The post was accompanied by pictures of the employee with other individuals believed to be pupils from at least two schools in the Grassy Park area. The faces in the pictures which surfaced online, were covered with emojis to protect the girls’ identities. In our report on Thursday, we incorrectly referred to Fairmount High instead of Fairmount Secondary. We apologise for the inconvenience caused. Cape Times
