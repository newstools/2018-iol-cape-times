Cape Town - The five-year-old therapy dog which went missing last week has reunited with his owner. Cashew, Michelle Koopman's therapy dog, was found at the Maitland Cemetery on Tueday afternoon. Cashew, a Jack Russell, went missing from 34th Avenue in Elsies River last week and a week-long search ended happily for Koopman. Koopman, who had a cash reward for the safe return of Cashew, found her dog while searching in the Maitland area. “I found him. I walked the entire Maitland Cemetry and railway and Edgemead. Went back to the graveyard and when we drove out, I screamed his name one last time.” She describes her beloved canine as one who helped her through a very low point in her life as she struggled with depression. "Before I met Cashew I was at a very low point in my life - he changed that. We are very close. He is very special. He is friendly, energetic and intelligent. He understands English."
