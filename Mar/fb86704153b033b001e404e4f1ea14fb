The Drakenstein Farm Watch, and NPO based in Paarl, said fires that plagued the region last year were as a result of human errors. Last week, while attending to a fire on an old mountain pass-road in Wellington, they found candles burning. "Around 12pm we received a call about some flames spotted by a by-passer on the old mountain pass-road. As we know that area to be very dangerous regarding fire, we asked our control-room to give the call to Cape Winelands Fire and we also decided to respond with 2 4x4 bakkie units and a 4x4 heavy duty response fire truck.
"Upon arrival we spotted the fire, which was still in the development phase and the teams rushed to the spot with hoses to fight the flames. Upon reaching the fire spot some men fled the scene and one fireman took the video to show the public how these incidents start. "This time we were there so quick, that no real damage was done, but given the drought, wind and the conditions of burning materials, we all know how it can develop," theÂ  Drakenstein Farm Watch said on Facebook. * This is a developing story
