Cape Town - Upgrades between Plattekloof Road and Old Oak Interchange is 50% complete, the provincial Department of Transport and Public Works said on Wednesday. The R487 million upgrade to 9 km of the N1 between Plattekloof Road and Old Oak is expected to be completed by April 2019. About 120 000 vehicles travel along the stretch of road during the morning inbound, and afternoon outbound traffic peaks. The department said the addition of a third lane in both directions will significantly reduce traffic congestion. "Work on installing the Freeway Management System, fibre optic bank, and Wemmershoek pipeline is complete, as is the Old Oak Interchange temporary bypass. Current work in progress includes the construction of inbound lane-widening earthworks from Durban Road to Jip De Jager, and the widening of Jip De Jager Interchange and its ramps," the department said. Construction at the Old Oak Intersection will cause some inconvenience to motorists until October. "This project is creating a number of short-term job and skills development opportunities. To date, R14 million has been spent on targeted labour while 17 434 person-days of work have been created for people from the City of Cape Town municipal area," the department said.
