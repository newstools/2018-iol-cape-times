Churchgoers waited in vain for the body of Awonke Manyakanyaka to be found. The bodies of two other men who drowned during the baptism were recovered on Sunday morning. They were members of St Paul’s Apostolic Faith Mission Church. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said a diving unit, air crew and lifesavers had resumed the search for Manyakanyaka at Monwabisi Beach. A member of the church, Luphumzo Sixisha, said congregants were anxious and unable to sleep because Manyakanyaka's body was still missing. Also yesterday, a woman was rescued after getting into difficulty at Rocklands Beach in Sea Point. She was taken to hospital. NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said the woman was found to be in a serious condition, suffering from symptoms of exhaustion. “The sea rescue craft Rotarian Schipper was launched from NSRI Bakoven and the sea rescue craft Spirit of Day was launched from NSRI Table Bay," he said. “The NSRI shore crew, a Western Cape government EMS rescue squad and EMS ambulance, the Cape Town fire and rescue service's dive unit, the SAPS, a Life Healthcare response paramedic and community medics responded. “Her identity was not known at the time and there appeared to be no family or friends with her. The circumstances surrounding how she got into difficulty in the surf are unknown.”
