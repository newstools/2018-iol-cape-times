The couple were robbed while walking the Brown-hooded Kingfisher Trail. They were staying in a private establishment close to the national park. SANParks’s Johan Jooste said although the suspects had been apprehended by police, it continued to roll out security plans for its Wilderness, Knysna and Tsitsikamma sections of the Garden Route National Park (GRNP). With Easter weekend approaching and preparations for the third annual Garden Route Walking Festival on Easter under way, ensuring safety of the GRNP and its visitors topped the agenda during a recent meeting between SANParks and police, the Traffic Department, security agencies, rescue organisations and community policing forums in Knysna. The meeting was aimed at discussing the risks, threats and vulnerabilities to the GRNP and visitors. Dubbed "Operation Reboot", the meeting’s input will be fed into a national safety and security strategy. SANParks spokesperson Nandi Mgwadlamba said: “We looked at some of the 
trends, vulnerabilities and risks that all three sections - Knysna, Wilderness and Tsitsikamma - of the GRNP are exposed to. “We are making wildlife crime our core focus, and we take them seriously.” Equipping rangers with fresher skills and strengthening alliances with other law enforcement authorities formed part of the short-to-medium-term interventions. Spanning 155 000 hectares, the GRNP included water bodies, forests and fynbos areas, said GRNP parks manager Paddy Gordon. “The open-access nature of the park could make us vulnerable, but we’re moving ahead with operational systems internally, as well as externally. The park is also fragmented, with pockets of private land in between,” Gordon said.
