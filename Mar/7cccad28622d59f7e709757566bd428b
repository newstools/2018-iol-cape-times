On Wednesday, Ramaphosa walked from Lookout Hill in Khayelitsha to the Rocklands Civic Centre in Mitchells Plain.  This was to promote a healthy lifestyle. After the walk Ramaphosa said: "This is wonderful time because this shows the non-racial character of our country. We got to go  and register to vote even of you you're registered go and check. Wed want all of our people to participate in the elections. These are going to be fantastic elections. This is the time when we are going to be saying this is a new dawn, this is a new era for our country. We want to move South Africa forward".

Two weeks ago Ramaphosa and about 200 others started an early morning walk from the Gugulethu sports ground to Athlone Stadium. Shortly into his term Ramaphosa made waves when he was captured walking along the Sea Point Promenade with former finance minister Trevor Manuel. In January, lucky beachgoers spotted Ramaphosa, then deputy president, walking along an East London beachfront.
