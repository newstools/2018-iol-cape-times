The six all-women crew have circumnavigated the globe, having touched Australia, New Zealand and the Falklands. They arrive in Cape Town tomorrow before returning to Goa after their voyage. The crew are set to make history by becoming the first Indian and Asian women to complete a circumnavigation of the globe on the INSV Tarini, skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi. They are expected at the V&A Waterfront Yacht Basin ahead of moving to the Royal Cape Yacht Club, where the Indian high 
commissioner and the consul-general will welcome them. South African dignitaries will also be in attendance. On Saturday, the SA Sailing Western Cape and Royal Cape Yacht Club (RCYC) are hosting a presentation and Q&A session at 11.30am, which is open to all. On Monday, a photo exhibition of the circumnavigation will be on display at RCYC. The exhibition is also open to all. SA Sailing Western Cape are assisting in the welcoming of the crew. The body's women and girls chairperson Shama Nathoo said: “The message to women is not to restrict yourself, and if you have a dream, do not hold back; the possibilities are out there. "Our drive is to encourage more women and girls involved.”
