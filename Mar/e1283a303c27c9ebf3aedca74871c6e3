The death of a Rotary marshall was under investigation. “For the vast majority of our cyclists and those working behind the scenes, the 2018 Cape Town cycle tour reached a successful culmination after months of hard work. But three families are in mourning for the three lives lost on the route this year. “We have received the sad news that late yesterday afternoon one of our Rotary marshalls passed away in hospital.
