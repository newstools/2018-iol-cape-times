Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed they were on high alert and out in force trying to quell tensions. A 32-year-old man was arrested and will appear at the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on charges of malicious damage to property and public violence on Thursday. Sporadic flare-ups ensued when the structures of the residents who had illegally occupied land were demolished in Nyanga and Gugulethu. Safety and security mayco member JP Smith said the City had increased its deployment levels in Gugulethu, Nyanga and Philippi East in the wake of a series of sporadic “hit and run” acts of unrest since Tuesday afternoon. “Incidents were recorded in those three areas, as well as on the N2 between the R300 and Borcherd’s Quarry. “The City can confirm that its Anti-Land Invasion Unit held an operation in Gugulethu and Nyanga, where pegs and structures linked to persistent land invasion attempts in recent weeks were removed,” said Smith. On Wednesday, the Govan Mbeki and Jakes Gerwel Drive links to the R300 northbound were temporarily closed. At Symphony and Stock roads, tyres were set alight and cars were stoned, according to the City. Mayor Patricia de Lille said the destruction of property during protest action would not be tolerated. “We respect everyone’s right to protests, but the violence and destruction cannot be condoned. “I am especially concerned about the impact that such actions will have on residents who are trying to go about their lives,” said De Lille. Western Cape Social Development MEC Albert Fritz said: “After yesterday’s (Tuesday) destructive and violent protest action, which forced the closure of the Gugulethu local office, the Department of Social Development has opted to completely suspend operations from that office.”  okuhle.hlathi@inl.co.za
