We need to retain as much water in storage as possible as we go into the summer of 2018/19," Bredell said. Theewaterskloof is currently at 10.7% (2017: 26.03%); Voëlvlei Dam is at 15.5% (2017: 31.2%) and Clanwilliam Dam 8% (2017: 30%).

I look forward to establishing a sound and productive working relationship with our new colleagues. We are available at their convenience to meet on the drought situation and I look forward to taking hands and tackling this crisis together. Only by working better together will we be able to provide long term sustainable solutions to the public," Bredell said.
