This after the Sea Point, Fresnaye and Bantry Bay Ratepayers and Residents' Association (SFBRRA) refuted claims their executive and planning committees had been taken over by property developers. Last month the association was publicly accused of having “vested interests”. SFBRRA chairperson, Marco van Embden, said its executive committee (Exco) consisted of volunteers, selected at an annual general meeting which was open to the public. “The SFBRRA ExCo rejects out of hand the allegations made by certain parties who are clearly determined to undermine the efforts of our volunteer ExCo members,” he said. “This committee has absolutely no regulatory authority, or any control over council’s decision-making process. "It exists only to consider planning applications for private and public space, and to provide comment on heritage considerations, title deed amendments and land use applications, or to provide general assistance to owners and residents of the area to ensure all developments comply with regulatory approval,” he said. Van Embden was the chairperson of luxury property development firm, The Blok, of which his son Jacques van Embden, also a member of SFBRRA ExCo, was the managing director. Jacques came under fire after his company became embroiled in court action, as they sought to evict a group of tenants in Bromwell Street, Woodstock. Ndifuna Ukwazi co-director Jared Rossouw said the idea that developers were simply volunteers on the planning committee was “laughable”.
