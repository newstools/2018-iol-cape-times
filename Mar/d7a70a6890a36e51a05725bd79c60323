The water donation was transported from Springs in Gauteng and was donated by logistics company, Orliflex. Orliflex was invited to the second annual Cape Town Motor Show event and used the opportunity to donate water to the city in a drought crisis. Four trucks arrived in Cape Town on Friday, after one of the trucks broke down during the 24-hour trip. Beneficiaries includes Cheshire Home Langa for people with severe and permanent disabilities, Meg’s Mutts Rescue, Daisy Animal Rescue Trust, Home of Hope Cape Town, for abused and abandoned children with foetal alcohol syndrome disorder, Mdzananda Animal Clinic and South African Mass Animal Sterilisation Clinic in Khayelitsha. Managing director of Orliflex, Sarita Gerber, said: “We were inundated with donations from schools and businesses in Pretoria and on the East Rand, and were thrilled to be entrusted with ensuring the water reached its intended recipients. "We were disappointed to experience technical difficulties with one of the trucks, and the packing of this volume of water proved to be a huge logistical challenge. "Disaster struck when three layers of stacked pallets
collapsed and crushed some of the water. We worked late 
into the night to repack the water and only four of the trucks were able to travel,” she said. The Cape Town Motor Show, hosted at the GrandWest Casino and Entertainment World, took over spaces spanning the length and breadth of the popular location, showcasing four- and two-wheeled action for all ages. As part of the weekend’s give-aways, one lucky winner walked away with a Ford F100 truck and another winner walked away with a Kawasaki Ninja Bike valued at over R70000. WFI Auto Detailing are currently adding the finishing touches to the late '70s Ford Model truck that is a blend of old-school muscle with a roaring engine and wide body lines, coupled with all the new trimmings one would expect on a car today.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
