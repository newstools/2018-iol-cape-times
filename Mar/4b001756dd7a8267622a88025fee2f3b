But their dreams may not come through as the youngsters from the Dash Leopards Soccer School need funds. They have been invited to participate in the Open Easter Tournament in the Netherlands, and compete in eight games over the two-day competition. Unfortunately, they have fallen short of their goal for funding, says coach and founder Ricardo Phillips. He said the school was started last year and has taken off as it provides the youth of Hangberg with an alternative to the harsh realities they experience within their communities. “We have a group of talented youngsters and we were hoping to take one under-11 and one under-14 team to the tournament. The majority of the players come from poor families and even after the fundraising events we held, with the costs for hosting and other expenses, we were far from our objective of R300 000,” said Phillips. Since its establishment, the school’s  numbers have swelled to the extent that an under-15 team will be added to the project’s existing under-11 and under-13 squads. Along with its three-day-a-week soccer component is an after-care and study programme, which sees coaches assisting the school’s 30 pupils with homework and the teaching of life skills. Working in the football industry as a coach and scout for the past 15 years, Phillips said the tournament would not just be a chance-in-a-lifetime for the children, but may open doors for the very talented youth he coaches. “What we do here is more than just football,we instil a desire to better each individual beyond their circumstances and challenge them to do better both in terms of football and academics. Now some of our youngsters will more than likely miss out because we do not have enough funds to take two teams as we have (only) raised just over R60 000,” said Phillips.
