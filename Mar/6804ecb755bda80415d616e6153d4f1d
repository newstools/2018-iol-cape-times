Cape Town- Convicted child rapist Enoch Lefuthane appeared briefly in the Western Cape High Court on Thursday to appeal his sentencing. In 2014 Lefuthane was sentenced to serve 34 years in jail for raping three young boys. Lefuthane initially decided to represent himself at his appeal, but on Thursday morning he told the court he rather wanted legal aid. Lefuthane will remain in custody at the Drakenstein Prison until his next court appearance, which is yet to be decided. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: “Lefuthane was found guilty in September (2014) on seven counts: three of rape, three of abduction and one of kidnapping. He was acquitted, however, on three counts of attempted murder.” Lefuthane initially faced 15 charges for similar crimes between 2005 and 2012 in Stellenbosch and in the Eastern Cape. These incidents were alleged to have involved five boys who at the time were between the ages of six and 10.
