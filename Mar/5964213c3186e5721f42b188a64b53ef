The humanitarian organisation delivered the water with four trucks. It was approached for help by the Western Cape Provincial Disaster Management over the past weekend. Gift of the Givers founder,Imtiaz Sooliman, said the water would be distributed to communities that live along the Berg River.   “While there are alternative sources of water, some of these communities have already been unable to get water from their taps since February. "There must be a careful distinction between the drinking water and alternative sources for irrigation and sanitation, and if the water supply meets the needs of the communities,” said Sooliman. On Tuesday, he said delivery of bottled water, totalling 112 pallets, was the first of one million bottles to be delivered to the region. Sooliman said institutions and schools regularly contacted them for assistance and they have supplied care facilities and schools with boreholes. The Drakenstein Municipality implemented Level 6B water restrictions, allowing 50 litres of water a person a day and increased water tariffs since February 16, with the Berg River dam estimated at 49.0% on Tuesday. Drakenstein Municipality spokesperson Riana Geldenhuys said the municipality welcomed the assistance of the NGO. “Should the area run out of existing surface water, the municipality will be able to immediately switch over to groundwater sources. Its borehole programme will put the municipality in a position to provide residents with 25 litres of water a person a day.” Cape Times
