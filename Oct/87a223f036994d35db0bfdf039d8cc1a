There are 36 players, including 12 girls, who will be part of the inaugural event to be staged at Masiphumelele Primary School on October 12. The foundation's head coach, Sivuyile Mfunelwa, who's from Khayelitsha, believes the competition will bring the best out of these rising stars. “Most of these players have never played in a big event like this before. "This is a good way of introducing them to competition, with the hope that in the near future they will move from 6-a-side to the full 11-a-side format.” Mfunelwa said a healthy rivalry has developed in the township and he expects a highly competitive environment on match day. “There is a lot of pride and bragging rights on the line. We are expecting everyone to give their best. "The tournament provides important game time for these young players to test and execute all the skills they learned and practised during the winter off-season.” In the space of just four years, GKF’s Township Cricket Development programme has elevated the sport in the region. Hundreds of boys and girls have been introduced to the game with many going on to play club and provincial cricket. Gary Kirsten said he was delighted with the initiative and is looking forward to watching these youngsters exhibit their skills. “It is a wonderful opportunity for the young players within the GKF Foundation's coaching programme to put their skills to the test. "We are very excited about the tournament, thankful to the sponsor and just looking forward to seeing the abundance of talent that we know exists in the township.”
