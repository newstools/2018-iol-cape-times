The body of an unknown woman has been found by a passer-by in an Athlone area plagued by criminal activity. Police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed the body of a woman estimated to be in her thirties was discovered on a hockey field on Tuesday. “We can confirm that the circumstances surrounding the death of a female in her thirties are being investigated after her body was discovered on a hockey field in Athlone earlier today. No one has been arrested as yet,” Traut said. Athlone community police forum chairperson Aziza Kannemeyer said the woman has not yet been identified. “We do not have much information at this stage but it is believed the woman has been dead for some time due to the state of decomposition. She was discovered by a passer-by in an area that is a well-known hot spot for criminal activity,” she said. Kannemeyer said the area is a mixture of two large informal settlements near the Vlei in Athlone, which has been tormented by criminal activities such as gangsterism, drug abuse and prostitution. “This area really needs serious attention. It needs a collective organised operation to target these ills. Even though the police goes into the area, they are also sometimes even targeted because residents have a protective stance of that community. “We had neighbouring residents complain about the activity in the area. Although there are good people in the informal settlements, unfortunately, they are not the majority,” she said. Kannemeyer said although police frequent the area and carry out raids, it is a largely “uncontrolled environment”.
