Cape Town - Murder and rape accused Eben van Niekerk claims he was forced to write a letter to Hannah Cornelius's parents. But  Sergeant Steven Adams maintains it was Van Niekerk who had asked for a pen and paper. "That is untrue your honour," Sergeant Steven Adams told the Western Cape High Court on Monday, News24 reported. "Your honour, I didn't even know he was going to write a letter. He just asked for a pen and paper." After Adams had taken Van Niekerk to a doctor, a news report about Cornelius's death was on the radio. "Am I in trouble?" Van Niekerk asked, according to Adams. Adams said he did not even know what Van Niekerk was under investigation for at the time and said he didn't know. Once he put Van Niekerk back in a cell, the accused asked for a pen and some paper. The sergeant gave it to him and carried on with his work. Van Niekerk later gave Adams a letter, which the sergeant claimed he gave to his branch commander the following day. However, Van Niekerk disputes that this is what happened. His advocate, Dudley Johnson, said the letter that Van Niekerk signed was "made under duress" at Adams's instructions and without Van Niekerk being read his rights. Adams said the claim was not true but admitted that he didn't personally read Van Niekerk his rights because he didn't know what he was going to do with the pen and paper. Cornelius's mother died in March this year. Her body was found floating at Scarborough beach. Her father is retired Simon's Town magistrate Willem Cornelius. Van Niekerk, Nashville Julies, Vernon Witbooi and Geraldo Parsons have been charged with murder, kidnapping and rape, and for the severe attack on Cornelius's friend, Cheslin Marsh, who survived. They are also accused of robbing another woman of her handbag on May 27, 2017 – the day Cornelius was found dead. The trial continues on Tuesday. Cape Times
