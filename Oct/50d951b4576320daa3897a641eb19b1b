From Khayelitsha, Delft, Rooi Els, and Hermanus, the participants, aged between four and 75, had disabilities ranging from cerebral palsy and autism to amputations, quadriplegia, hypoxic brain injuries and polio. The event was the initiative of Roxy Davis, nine-time South African surfing champion and owner of Surf Emporium in Muizenberg, in collaboration with Adaptive Surfing SA. “This day, and the joy clearly visible for those with disabilities, shows how much we need support to make dreams come true. The turnout from Warrior on Wheels Foundation, local media and influencers was amazing. “To witness as many as 12 people support a person, train them, lift them into the sea, keep them afloat and push them into the waves, then catch them at the end of the ride is a sight to behold,” she said. Davis said the Surf Emporium was fortunate to be able to help effect such change. “It’s a privilege to share surfing and its physical and mental benefits with others. Hopefully, this focus on growing adaptive surfing will allow others to bring home more titles like the one Anthony Smyth won a couple of weeks ago in California.” The oldest participant, Pamela Hansford, 75, emerged paralysed from an accident earlier this year. “When I woke up I thought ‘at least I’m a candidate for Adaptive Surfing’. I had a goal. Fortunately, I was still able to work in the water with two outstanding physiotherapists in preparation for this great day, hopefully the first of many,” she said. Adaptive surf champion Anthony Smyth, who assisted the surfers, said the sea and surfing were therapeutic. “Surfing brings you in touch with nature, it challenges you, scares you and makes you happy. Surfing is like medicine, and I think it’s particularly therapeutic for people with disabilities because it’s a leveller - it takes away the obstacles disabled people face on land and puts you on the same level as able-bodied people, in a sense.”
