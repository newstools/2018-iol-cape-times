The International Maritime Rescue Federation awards aim to recognise some of the exceptional individuals and organisations around the world that make maritime search and rescue possible. The NSRI launched the initiative after finding that in many cases those attempting to rescue others ended up drowning. The buoys have been strategically placed on beaches where lifeguards are not present and have instructions on how to use them. Since they were launched last November, at least 13 people have been rescued using them. NSRI chief executive Dr Cleeve Robertson said: “It’s often the simple things that save lives - in this case, the simple act of placing a Pink Rescue Buoy in proximity to a water risk.” The IMRF’s chief executive, Theresa Crossley, congratulated the organisation on its nomination. The event will be held at the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue, in Horten, Norway.
