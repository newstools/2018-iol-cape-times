Humanitarian aid organisation Gift of the Givers has welcomed the arrest of a 21-year-old man in connection with the murder of a volunteer in Philippi. Twenty-year-old Ameerodien Noordien was shot and killed when he was caught in gang crossfire in Hanover Park last week. Police say the suspect handed himself over to authorities. Gift of the Givers spokesperson Dr Imtiaz Sooliman told the SABC on Thursday: “But let this only be the beginning of all those other people, innocent people who have been killed. "Let those dockets be reopened and let this be the beginning of bringing all those people to book. My special thanks go to the police minister and his generals and all the police who worked so diligently to make an arrest in such a short space of time.” Police launched a manhunt amid a public outcry over Ameerodien's death. Police Minister Bheki Cele attended his funeral service on Monday, where he announced the formation of an anti-gang unit for Cape Town.
