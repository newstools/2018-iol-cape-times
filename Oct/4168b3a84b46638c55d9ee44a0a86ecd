CAPE TOWN - The man accused of the murder of Cape Town biker Zelda van Niekerk, who was shot and killed during a robbery on the N1 highway on Friday, appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Lucien Ackerman, 33, along with his two unknown accomplices, allegedly attacked the 45-year-old Van Niekerk on Friday afternoon after she stopped to wait for another biker on the busy N1 highway under the N7 bridge. Ackerman was arrested by the City of Cape Town’s specialised units following a tip-off, a few hours after the incident. A search of his premises in Kensington reportedly turned up a firearm and ammunition, as well as bank cards and a driver's licence allegedly belonging to the victim. Bikers from across the city gathered outside the court to call for no bail for the accused. Ackerman was remanded and the matter postponed to November 23. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. African News Agency (ANA)
