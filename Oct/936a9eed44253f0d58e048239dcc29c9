“Children were brought to the hospital with traumatic injuries ranging from dog bites and burns (hot water, electrical and flame), to a gunshot, snake bites and motor vehicle accidents,” said hospital spokesperson Dwayne Evans. World Trauma Day was commemorated yesterday to emphasise the importance of applying critical measures to deal with and avoid trauma. The Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital used the day to highlight injuries suffered by children. “The high number of injuries reported indicates a profound lack of adequate parental and adult supervision when children are at home. The top three killers of children are traffic (pedestrians and unrestrained children), drownings and burns. “Let’s make sure we protect our little ones this season,” Evans said. With the festive season approaching, the hospital has urged parents to be extra vigilant. ChildSafe campaign executive director Yolande Baker said many of the traumatic injuries children were exposed to were preventable. ChildSafe is a campaign of the Child Accident Prevention Foundation of Southern Africa and Safe Kids Worldwide. “With the school holidays coming up, you will have children at home that will be unsupervised because parents continue to work. “Parents just need to relay information to their children that accidents do happen. “Children can drown, they can burn with candles falling over, they can fall at all types of places and the big one is road traffic accidents.” “Over weekends we typically see collisions involving families, and during the week we see taxi collisions involving schoolchildren,” says John Ramcharan, ER24 Vaal branch manager.
