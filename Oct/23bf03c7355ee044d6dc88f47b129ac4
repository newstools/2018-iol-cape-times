CAPE TOWN – With the relaxation of the rules regarding overseas-based players by new coach Rassie Erasmus, it seemed entirely possible – Springbok captain Siya Kolisi packing up and finding greener pastures in England after next year’s World Cup. After all, Western Province are still battling financially, and the SA Rugby Union aren’t exactly flush with cash themselves at the moment. Rumours began in the UK last week linking Kolisi to three English clubs – Sale Sharks, Saracens and Wasps. It made sense not only from a financial point of view for the 27-year-old Kolisi to go north, as there are Bok teammates at all three of those clubs, such as Faf de Klerk, Vincent Koch and Willie le Roux, to make him feel right at home. It would also have presented an interesting dilemma to SA Rugby, as they would have to decide whether they would want an overseas-based captain. But those talks won’t be taking place – at least not anytime soon. Kolisi’s agent Hilton Houghton rubbished the idea of the Bok loose forward wanting to move to England after next year’s World Cup in Japan. Kolisi is contracted to WP until the end of next season, as are other Cape Boks such as Steven Kitshoff, Bongi Mbonambi, Frans Malherbe, Eben Etzebeth and Pieter-Steph du Toit. Etzebeth has also been linked with a move to French giants Toulon, and that may still happen after the World Cup. But Kolisi is staying put in South Africa. “Absolutely no truth to the irresponsible rumour regarding Siya. Siya is not going anywhere,” Houghton told IOL Sport on Thursday. “I will meet with stakeholders in due course, being SARU and WP (to discuss a new contract for Kolisi).” The Bok flank is currently on a break following the Rugby Championship, sitting out the rest of the Currie Cup before the end-of-year tour to Europe. The South Africans are next in action against England at Twickenham on November 3.               @ashfakmohamed  IOL Sport   Like IOL Sport on Facebook      Follow IOL Sport on Twitter
