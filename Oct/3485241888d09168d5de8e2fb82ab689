Cape Town – A heatwave alert has been issued for Cape Town and surrounding areas, ending tomorrow, says SA Weather Service senior forecaster Thabisile Ntleko. Friday is expected to be a more bearable 30°C, but the mercury is expected to soar again to a high of at least 37 degrees by Sunday. Partly cloudy to clear conditions, with warm to hot temperatures, were expected over the following week, Ntleko said. “Temperatures for Cape Town range in the high 20s to mid-to-high 30s. Cooling is expected next week Monday with the passage of a cold front in the afternoon. “A possibility of light rain can be expected Monday afternoon into the evening, with temperatures dropping down to the low 20s,” Ntleko said. The hot weather and dry conditions, however, also means there is a high risk of runaway fires. The public is urged to report fire outbreaks across the province as soon as possible, using the emergency number 112. Cape Times
