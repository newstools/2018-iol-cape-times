Cape Town – Police have appealed for information that can help solve the murder of ANC ward councillor Luyanda Mbele and his cousin. The 44-year-old Mbele and his cousin were shot and killed in Wallacedene, Kraaifontein, at about 9pm yesterday. Mbele, who lived with his mother, was the ward councillor for Bloekombos in Kraaifontein. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said detectives are working around the clock in an effort to find the perpetrators, the SABC reported. "Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident at about 21:00 at Ndeleni Street, Wallacedene, Kraaifontein, where two males age 44 and 40 were shot and fatally wounded by unknown suspects, are under investigation. "A double murder case is currently under investigation. Anyone with any information about this fatal incident is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111." Western Cape ANC secretary Faiez Jacobs told News24 the party was "shocked and saddened" by the "senseless killing" of Mbele. "He was a fiercely strong community leader and an active councillor in that area," Jacobs said. But Jacobs added that Mbele had been on edge because he "knew that something was wrong. People were after him". "He was a transport activist, concerned about challenges, especially in the rail and taxi industry. He was a fighter for affordable, reliable public transport for all, especially the poor," Jacobs said. "The whole community of Bloekombos is reeling with shock. People are very angry that someone who was well liked by the community should die in this way."
