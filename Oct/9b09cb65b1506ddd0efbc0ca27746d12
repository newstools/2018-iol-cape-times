The Africana’s 52-day operation will take place from Hondeklip Bay in the Northern Cape to Port Alfred in the Eastern Cape. The purpose and objectives of the survey are to conduct acoustic sampling to detect the abundance of pelagic species (anchovy, sardine, round herring, horse mackerel and mesopelagic fish) through the use of acoustics detectors; fish biological sampling by measuring length frequency distributions, sex and gonad maturity staging, fat staging, fish egg and environmental sampling. The collection of these data has a direct impact in the estimation of the total allowable catch for the South African Pelagic Fishing Industry. The department has also started a process of sourcing a modern and efficient replacement vessel in its efforts to improve South Africa’s fisheries research capacity and capabilities. This will enable the department to develop and sustain its deep-water research and contribute to maintaining the levels of employment in the fisheries. The vessel, over 35 years old, has surpassed its life expectancy by seven years and recently underwent repairs, severely impacted by the availability of spare parts, particularly the main engine bearings, which are no longer available off the shelf. Africana had its scheduled 6 000-hour service to the port and starboard main engine after its last scientific survey of 2017 which was successfully completed last December.
