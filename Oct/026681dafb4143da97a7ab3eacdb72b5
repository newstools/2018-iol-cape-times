The competition took place last week at the Knysna Mall, where Sedgefield Primary and Hornlee Primary schools shared the top prize of R15 000 each. Sue Swain, from BioWise, said 10 of the participating 12 schools submitted entries. “Schools had to undertake activities that promote earth-savvy living, which included being water-wise, waste-wise, space-wise and energy-wise. “The quality of the entries was of such a high standard that it took more than a week of deliberation by programme partners to determine the winners.” Ashford School had stood out not just for their entries in all categories, but also because they introduced the children to a research-based methodology, she said. “The children created different sized wind turbines of recycled plastic bottles and tested them in different locations. They made solar panels, rainwater gauges, bottle brick structures and vertical gardens.”
