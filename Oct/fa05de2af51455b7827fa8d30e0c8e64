Non-profit organisation SOS, in partnership with the world’s biggest pump manufacturer Grundfos, has announced a long-term plan to supply much-needed water to the Bloekombos area in Kraaifontein. This initiative has been established to help businesses as well as schools in the area. SOS director Shelley Humphrey said: “We will install water towers to provide Bloekombos with non-potable water for car-washing and irrigation for their micro-farms. “We will also assist with alternate water sources for all six schools in the settlement, as well as the HIV clinic, churches and other micro-businesses there.” The partnership project is also supported by M’hudi Farm, neighbour to the 45 000-strong settlement and the first fully black-owned wine farm in South Africa, and will begin with the installation of eight 5 000-litre water tanks at Masibambane Secondary School. Grundfos is the world’s leading pump manufacturers, with over 16 000 employees and annual production of more than 16 million pump units a year, setting the standard in terms of innovation, efficiency, reliability and sustainability for their water solutions
