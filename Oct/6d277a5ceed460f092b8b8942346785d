Johannesburg - The provincial government in the Western Cape says it has received clean audits in 24 out of 25 reports for the  2017/18 financial year. It said the Department of Health received a clean audit outcome on its financial statements, but its overall audit was “unqualified” due to what it called minor technical matters. "At the core of this government’s brand lies good financial governance," Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said. "The quality of our audits confirms the high standard of financial management within the Western Cape public sector. " Western Cape finance minister Dr Ivan Meyer said robust engagements between the provincial Treasury and departments had laid the basis for embedding good financial governance. He said the various levels of assurance bodies - including the audit committees, internal audit, the auditor general and the oversight committees of parliament - had all played a vital role in ensuring public funds were accounted for. “We remain committed to a clean administration and the audit results bear not only testimony to this but also justifies the confidence the people of the Western Cape have in this government,” said Meyer. The Western Cape is the only province in South Africa controlled by the national opposition Democratic Alliance, with the other eight all run by the ruling African National Congress.
