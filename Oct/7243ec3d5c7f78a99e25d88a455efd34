Event organisers said they strived to limit the use of single-use plastic, which was a challenge. Waterfront Rotary Club member Siham Boda, said the event had three categories - the Mile, Half Mile and Elite - with each including a wetsuit and skin swim division. “The Waterfront Rotary Club was very proud to host this inaugural Waterfront Canal Challenge, together with the support of the V&A Waterfront. “We were delighted to see so many people participating and so many families enjoying this space. We hope this will become an annual fund-raiser to attract much-need funds for our community projects,” Boda said. She said swimmers’ ages ranged from eight to 72, and those placed in the first three paces of their category received a prize, with the top male and female swimmers receiving cash prizes at the weekend. Boda said Michele Weber won the Female Elite Skins and Eric le Roux took the Male Elite Skins. Big Bay Events company ensured the safety of the swimmers with lifeguards in the water. The Two Oceans Aquarium informed the event’s spectators about the harmfulness of single-use plastic. Through primary and high school pupils’ creative entries in the event’s “Art from Ocean Trash” competition, they drew attention to the plight of marine life threatened by plastic pollution. Cash prizes were sponsored by Pick n Pay and food and refreshments were on sale.
