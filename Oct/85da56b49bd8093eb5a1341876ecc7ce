The SA Human Rights Commission used the day to focus on the contributions made by older persons to achieve social justice under this year’s theme “Celebrating Older Human Rights Champions”. SAHRC spokesperson Gushwell Brooks said: “Older people have always played a significant role in society, as leaders, caretakers, parents, activists and more. "As we celebrate International Day for Older Persons, the commission remembers the contributions and sacrifices made by older persons in pursuit of a free and fair democratic society in South Africa.” Brooks said the national celebrations of the centenary of Nelson Mandela and Mama Albertina Sisulu provided a snapshot of the array of older human rights champions with which society had been gifted. “In this regard, the commission wishes to express its gratitude all older persons, and particularly to the older human rights champions in South Africa, for their contributions.” The commission added that “many older persons are highly vulnerable, with many falling into poverty”. It called on the government to sign the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights Of Older Persons in Africa adopted by the AU in January 2016.
