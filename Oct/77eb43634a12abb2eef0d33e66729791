City mayoral committee member for water, waste and energy Xanthea Limberg said some ratepayers were charged twice, but stressed that not all consumers were affected. “Certain accounts will reflect the monthly fixed basic charge twice due to the billing cycle variance. These accounts pertain to accounts which overlap into two calendar months (eg with the current scenario, this will mean a fixed basic charge billing for September and October is reflected). "Effectively, the billing system will bill the customer for a fixed basic charge 12 times only in total in the financial year.” ANC councillor Delmaine Cottee accused the DA of stealing from the poor. “Check your municipal account for October 2018, with an increase on your fixed charges from R100 to R200 for a 20mm pipe. The City reduces restrictions from level 6B to 5B, but still increases fixed charges on 15mm pipe its R56 (no increase) and on a 20mm pipe charges increases from R100 to R200 without consultation, and that was a pipe installed 'donkey’s years' ago,” Cottee said. ANC Western Cape elections head Ebrahim Rasool said: “We are going door to door in every town and suburb and getting more people to join our court action. The City have shown that they are not willing to engage on this matter. People are suffering with high bills and they have thrown a blind eye to this.” Asked for comment on Monday, the City said no court date had been set. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
