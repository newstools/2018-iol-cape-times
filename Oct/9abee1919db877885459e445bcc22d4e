The man accused of strangling his mother to death and then hiding her body in a wheelie bin may be freed after his case was postponed for a final time. Shakoor Roberts, 25, appeared at Mitchells Plain Regional Court on Wednesday where his trial was to get under way. But proceedings were hit by yet another postponement when the court was informed that the doctor who had performed the post-mortem on his mother, Gafsa Roberts, 61, was not present. The matter was postponed last month for the doctor to make a correction in the medical report, where the word throttled was spelt incorrectly. On Wednesday, the magistrate ordered the matter be postponed for a final time to 8 November. If the State is not ready to proceed, the matter may be taken off the roll. The decision left Gafsa’s daughter, Rushana Adams, in tears, who fear they may now never see justice for her mom. Gafsa’s badly decomposed body was found hidden in a bin outside her home in Winterhoek Street, Tafelsig, by neighbours, who only recognised her by her hair in March 2015. Shakoor, who lived alone with his sickly mother was arrested and charged the same day. However, the charges were provisionally withdrawn two days later due to a lack of evidence. Family members also claim Roberts is a satanist and that his mother feared him and slept with a knife under her pillow. Roberts is a diagnosed schizophrenic. Daily Voice
