Four gang members who went on a shooting spree in Elsies River, targeting six people and eventually killing one, have been convicted and are expected to be sentenced later this month. Rodrigo Coetzee, Emilio Walters, Jamian Links and Taswill du Preez were convicted under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (Poca). Coetzee and Walters were further convicted of murder and attempted murder. According to court documents, the four men are members of the “Bad Rush” gang in Elsies River and in September 2016 all of them were armed when they opened fire at the residence of Angelo le Roux. They shot at Le Roux and two others, before running down the road and shooting at three more. Leo-Junior Dominic eventually died after being rushed to hospital. The four are expected to be sentenced on October 24, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said. Meanwhile, a 38-year-old arrested for being in possession of an unlicensed firearm in Bonteheuwel appeared in court this week. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the suspect was arrested following a tip-off. “Bonteheuwel satellite police station received information about a gang member who was armed in Saffraan Road, Bonteheuwel. "The members acted swiftly on the information and on their arrival they managed to arrest the suspect for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. "The suspect is due to make a court appearance on a charge of possession of an unlicensed firearm in the Bishop Lavis Magistrate's Court,” Van Wyk said. The arrested followed that of a 20-year-old for possession of a firearm and ammunition in Manenberg. “The suspect, who was still holding the firearm in his hand, was ordered to drop it. He was arrested for the possession of a 9mm pistol and a magazine with 14 live rounds,” Van Wyk said.
