A warrant of arrest was issued on Thursday for the student caught trying to depart South Africa with nearly R10 million in US dollars. Fayrooz Saleh, 22, did not arrive for the commencement of her case in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court, TimesLive reported. Her lawyer, Ori Moloi, told the court he had last spoken to Saleh on Wednesday‚ when she informed him that she was ill. He had no idea on whether she intended to arrive for the day's proceedings. The State prosecutor Mcosini requested that the court issue a warrant of arrest. A warrant was issued and the trial postponed to October 25‚ when it would be determined whether she would lose the R20 000 bail she was granted. Meanwhile‚ Mcosini said he had been informed by the defence that they were finalising Saleh's plea. If her guilty plea is accepted‚ the court could order that she pay a fine that could amount to treble the value of the goods she failed to declare or serve a maximum of two years in jail. Salem was found with US notes wrapped in a black plastic bag in her hand luggage as she was about to board a flight to Hong Kong at OR Tambo International Airport on September 11. She claimed the money did not belong to her but could not reveal the owner of the cash. Salem faces charges of contravening the Customs and Excise Act as well as the Prevention of Organised Crime Act.
