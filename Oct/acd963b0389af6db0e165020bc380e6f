President Cyril Ramaphosa will pay tribute to Tutu when he delivers the Desmond Tutu annual lecture at the Artscape on Monday. Mayor Patricia de Lille said: “There are never enough words to say thank you to the Arch for what he has done for our country and he still remains an example to us. I hope he and mam Leah have a happy and blessed birthday today,” she said. Tutu received thousand of tributes through social media including from former public protector Thuli Madonsela who tweeted: “Happy birthday Archbishop Emeritus #DesmondTutu. Thank you for your selfless contribution to the betterment of humanity. Blessings today and the days ahead.” The official Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation also tweeted, saying: “Happy 87th birthday to our Founder Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. Wishing you a beautiful day and may God continue to bless you as you bless all of us.” The ANC said Tutu was not only an extraordinary human being, he also served as a reminder of the role that he played in bringing apartheid to its knees and restoring the dignity of all South Africans.
