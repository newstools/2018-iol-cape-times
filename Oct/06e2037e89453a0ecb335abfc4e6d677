Cape Town - A Manenberg resident was shot dead in what is thought to have been a gang-related shooting near a police station yesterday. Residents on their way to work and pupils on their way to school were greeted by the grim scene just after 7.30am. The man was on his way to work when he was approached by a group of about four men. According to a police source, one of the assailants pulled out his firearm and shot the man. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident on the corners of Venster Street and Blouberg Road in which a 30-year-old man was shot and (killed) and a 36-year-old injured are under investigation.” Anyone with information relevant to the case can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 0860010111, or SMS Crime Line on 32211. In another incident, vigilant Metro Police officers arrested a man on charges of culpable homicide at the weekend. City spokesperson Ruth Solomons said the intoxicated 51-year-old man was arrested on Friday evening. “Officers on patrol along the N2 spotted a car driving on the wrong side of the road between Baden Powell Drive and Spine Road. They gave chase and managed to get the driver to stop. "Not only did they detect the smell of alcohol on the man’s breath, but one of the officers also noticed fresh blood and hair on the vehicle, as well as damage to the windscreen. “A call to the control room confirmed that a hit-and-run accident was being attended to by Macassar SAPS near the Engen garage on the N2. "The man was arrested and handed over to SAPS to investigate whether his vehicle was involved in the accident,” Solomons said. Cape Times
