Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “According to reports, on Monday around noon the suspect, a former student at the school, managed to gain entry and went straight to the victim and stabbed him several times on his upper body. “The victim was transported to a nearby hospital where he is still recovering.” Initially, it was thought that the pupil had died. Jessica Shelver, spokesperson for Western Cape Education Department MEC Debbie Schäfer, sent a statement saying the department had been informed yesterday that the pupil was alive but still in a critical condition.
