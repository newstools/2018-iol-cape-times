Ndamase’s coronation took place at Nyandeni Great Place in Libode on Wednesday. AmaMpondo aseNyandeni is comprised of three towns of Libode, Port St Johns and Ngqeleni and their surrounding villages. There has been controversy in the kingship after the Nhlapo Commission downgraded the kingdom into a principal traditional authority in 2010, but the nation stood behind its kingdom saying it was legitimate. Ndamase’s coronation also comes just weeks after the Constitutional Court retained Nhlapo Commission’s findings that King Zanozuko Sigcau is the only legitimate ruler of AmaMpondo as a whole. Sigcau did not attend the coronation. Ndamase is the second king after Xhosa king Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu, to be installed in democratic South Africa. Speaking after being enrobed with lion skin, which according to the royal culture symbolises victory, courage and bravery, he thanked the attendees for their support. “Thank you to you AmaMpondo and other nations for coming here. I am lost for words. I will forever cherish you,” he said. Ndamase said development would be at the top of his agenda. “Nyandeni has coastal towns that are underdeveloped. Let us work together to develop our area. There is too much unemployment in Port St Johns yet the area has enormous tourism prospects,” said Ndamase. Eastern Cape premier Phumulo Masualle said they co-operate with Nyandeni on issues of development. He congratulated Ndamase saying his ancestors would be proud of the installation. Cape Times
