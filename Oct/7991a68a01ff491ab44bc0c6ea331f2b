Garden Route residents have been urged to be on the lookout for a German tourist who went missing near Plettenberg Bay over four weeks ago. The 26-year-old Niels Frederik Szenbek has been spotted in Wilderness since his disappearance on September 15, the SABC reported. This is not the first time Szenbek has gone missing. Szenbek had left his passport, cellphone and some of his luggage at the accommodation he booked into. Wesley Andrew, from the Plettenberg Bay Crime Prevention Association, who has been in contact with his family, told the SABC this is not the first time Szenbek has gone missing. “They have confirmed that he has had a history of some sort of psychological issues and he has done something like this before he left Germany, came down to SA and went missing for a while. "He was found in Wilderness. He actually had injured himself because he had gone on some mission into the forest. So please, if anyone does get eyes on Niels please contact the Plettenberg Bay police station.”
