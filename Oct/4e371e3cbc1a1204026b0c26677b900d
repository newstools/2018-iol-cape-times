The forum told a press conference at the Kraaifontein police station yesterday, that they engaged with station management and the sector commander to find solutions to reduce crime. Forum spokesperson Roto Sabelo said Mbele’s murder left residents in shock. Mathenjwa was shot dead when he tried to stop the gunman. Sabelo said when Kraaifontein was ranked among the areas with the highest crime rate in the country, they received a base camp which put police on residents’ doorsteps. When the initiative bore fruit, crime took a dip, Sabelo said. “The office of the sector commander assisted the community with a mobile trailer as a substitute to the base camp, but the trailer only lasted a few hours and it vanished. “As the sub-forum, we believe the presence of the base camp should have led to a quicker response to the murder of councillor Mbele and perpetrators could have been arrested, because the base camp was a few metres away from the place where the councillor was shot and killed. “We believe there are lots of firearms in wrong hands in the area of Kraaifontein, especially in Wallacedene. “We have also noted with an eye of an eagle, the illegal land grabbers who have attracted unknown criminals,” Sabelo said. He said the sub-forum had more than 200 patrollers who started patrolling after the announcement of the crime stats. “These dedicated crime fighters risk their lives for a crime-free Kraaifontein. “We therefore called on Minister of Police Bheki Cele to reinstate the based camp in Wallacedene within seven days,” Sabelo said. Cele visited Mbele’s family on Monday and said a special team had been assigned to investigate his killing. Cape Times
