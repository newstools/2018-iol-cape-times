The Sandvlei/Macassar areas were without water, said the city council. Other areas were likely to experience falling pressure and eventually outages later in the day. Four water tankers were deployed to provide drinking water in the affected areas. Tankers were stationed at the Macassar Village, Macassar Day Hospital (Musica Avenue), Akker Street, Soekmekaar Street and Sandvlei/Kramat areas. “Disaster Risk Management is also on the ground and will distribute 500 x 5-litre water bottles to the old-age home in Musica Avenue and early childhood development centres,” said mayoral committee member for water and waste services Xanthea Limberg. “The city apologises for any inconvenience caused and assures residents that every effort is being made to restore normal water supply as soon as possible,” she said.
