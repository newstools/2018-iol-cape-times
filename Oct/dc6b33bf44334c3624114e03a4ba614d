Members of the Anti-Gang Unit nabbed two suspects in Bishop Lavis on Thursday as part of their intensified approach against crime. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the men were arrested after they were found in possession of unlicensed firearms in Netreg. “Early this morning a man was shot and killed and another man wounded when suspects in a silver Mini Cooper opened fire at them. "This hijacked vehicle was later discovered abandoned in Robert Sobukwe Road. The shooting incident led to the deployment of our forces in the area in pursuit of the suspects. “While on patrol in the area, members of the Anti-Gang unit spotted a suspicious man who was running towards his residence in Olienhout Road in Bishop Lavis. "The 20-year-old suspect was followed and apprehended in possession of an unlicensed 9mm Glock and 35 rounds of ammunition. The residence was searched and another man, 37, was arrested for being in possession of a .22 rifle,” Traut said. The two suspects are expected to appear in court once they are charged for the possession of unlicensed firearms.
