Cape Town – On the day Police Minister Bheki Cele saluted new recruits for the Western Cape’s new Anti-Gang Unit at a parade at the Bishop Lavis Police Academy, three men were shot dead at the Nyanga Cata (Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association) taxi rank on Friday. Provincial detectives and crime scene experts were combing the scene for clues subsequent to the shooting, which occurred at about 2pm. "According to information, the shooting incident occurred this afternoon at about 14:00," police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana told News24. "Three men in their forties were shot and fatally wounded by unidentified men who entered a meeting and fired shots (at) the victims." A triple murder case has been opened for investigation. No has been arrested. According to the SABC, Cele said at the parade: “We have pulled together the group of women and men in blue. At the moment they are a task force (but) we will be converting them permanently as the Anti-Gang Unit working in the Peninsula. Already they have done a good job.” Community Safety MEC Dan Plato welcomed the introduction of the task team, saying: "I think it will bring the necessary comfort in so many of our communities. "They will take into custody, they will open cases, they will take dockets to court of law, to contain the drug and gang situation on the Cape Flats.”
