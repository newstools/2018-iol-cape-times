Over the weekend of October 20 to 21, in George and Sedgefield, the main event - the Kite Team Challenge - will see teams of three in an aerial battle using traditional Japanese-style fighting kites. Teams are given training and tips from professional kiters and are given kites to fly. For the past three years, it’s been the highlight of the festival, with teams of friends and companies getting into the heat of the battle. The addition of George to the festival was the brainchild of the George Rotary Club, and Rotary has undertaken to organise the extra day. The event also has the full support of George Tourism. Any team entering at George on October 20 gets an automatic entry to the competition at the Sedgefield part of the festival on October 21. There is also a competition for kites made from "upcycled" materials. The best creations will be judged by international kite-flyers on the creativity of design, workmanship and flying ability. Materials could include bin bags or shopping bags, newspapers, dowel sticks, bamboo and more. Everything must be ‘upcycled’, not bought. At a cost of R350 per team, the public can contribute to keeping a learner in school for a month. You can also switch team members between heats. For kite-building plans, visit www.kiteplans.org
