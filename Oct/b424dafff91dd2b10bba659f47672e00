The event, hailed as groundbreaking, is also part of Scott’s efforts to establish a foundation to teach modelling. It will be extended into a beauty salon where children with different abilities could learn skills and contribute to the beauty industry. Scott’s mother, Bahia Janodien, said: “Shumeez is taking on the world and, with her confidence, we know she will succeed. She would also like to progress further with learning to read and write, but for this she needs to attend a special school, where costs are very high.” She said the event on November 4 would feature young women and men. Scott won the Face of an Angel national competition - Miss DS Ribbon4Roses SA 2017 - in 2017. The event was for young females with Down Syndrome. She went to Mumbai, India, in March this year to receive her crown for having won the Miss MWI (magnificent women icon) Phenomenal SA 2018/2019 pageant. “And now they are crowning her with the international version of the title in Nigeria. She leaves on November 24 or 25 for Nigeria, where she was invited by the first lady of Nigeria for a state dinner,” said Janodien. Since coming back from India, the teenager had launched her own organisation, called the Shumeez Scott Foundation Centre. The fashion show will take place at 2pm at the Athlone Civic Centre. Tickets cost R80 each. For more information, contact Janodien at 071 443 6014 or Wafieka Haywood at 082 866 3979.
