The Western Cape Education Department says no incidents have been reported at schools during today's writing of the matric English papers. Most of the 53 000 full-time candidates who have registered for the exams are believed to have written the paper. Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Jessica Shelver told the SABC: “The 2018 examinations will continue until Wednesday the 28th of November. Learners are urged to stay focused until they have completed their final examination. "This is the final stretch after a 12-year school career. These next few weeks are critical and we wish all our candidates who are writing the very best until the final exam.” Meanwhile, Langa High School said it is aiming for a 70 percent matric pass rate this year. Seventy-four candidates wrote the English paper at the school today. Langa High deputy principal Nombeko Ndlolvu told the SABC: “We've got very dedicated learners who were really studying hard and I'm hoping we'll improve our results. "This year I hope we are going to get 70-plus (pass rate), but not less than 60 percent I'm sure.” Grade 12 pupils at Jan van Riebeeck High School (about 80 pupils sat the exam) in the CBD regarded the English paper to have been "fair", with some who "really enjoyed the comprehension".
