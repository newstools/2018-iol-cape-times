Cape Town – A father-of-four was allegedly brutally stoned to death by a group of youngsters at Northpine garage after he apparently failed to show them the gang number 27 with his hands. Brandon Tamesy was passing Tyreman when he was confronted by the gang on Sunday morning. According to a witness, Tamesy, 33, ran when he was unable to show them the number. They chased him and started beating him up even as he was pleading for his life. Security footage from Tyreman shows the entire incident and how Tamesy begged for his life. A source tells the Daily Voice: “One of the laaities could be heard bragging on camera, 'As hy die nommer gewys het, kon hy nog gelewe het' (if he showed us the number, he could still have been alive). “They threw a massive cement block on his head and removed his T-shirt. The block and the T-shirt could not be found at the scene when the police looked for it.” His mother, Margaret Tamesy, 53, says she was called to the scene at 3.30am on Sunday. “This is horrible. My family and I cannot believe he was taken from us in such a manner. “He was not working at the moment and his youngest has just turned 11 months,” says the distraught mother. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana says a case of murder has been opened for investigation. “According to reports a 33-year-old man... died due to his injuries. No arrests were made so far,” Rwexana said. Daily Voice
