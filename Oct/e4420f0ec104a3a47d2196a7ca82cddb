He was delivering a message of support at the Accelerating Inclusive Youth Employment and Solutions Exchange conference at Spier, Stellenbosch. The two-day conference began yesterday with 250 of the country’s leading decision-makers across the private and public sector. The objective is to highlight, discuss and develop solutions to accelerate inclusive youth employment. “At the recent Presidential Jobs Summit, social partners from government, business, labour and the community agreed on a far-reaching framework agreement for job creation. "At the centre of this agreement is youth employment. Our youth - with their talents, optimism and energy - are our greatest asset as we build a more inclusive and equitable economy. We need to ensure we deliver on the job creation targets we have set ourselves. “We need to focus our efforts and resources on growing the work opportunities available for young people. “This requires ensuring young people, especially those who are economically marginalised and vulnerable, have the means to take up and succeed in those opportunities,” he said. The event is co-hosted by the Presidency, the Human Resources Development Council, Yellowwoods, Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator and Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection.
