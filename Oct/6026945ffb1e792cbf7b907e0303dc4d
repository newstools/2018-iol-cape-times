A high school in Wellington has been left in shock after a pupil's fatal heart attack. Anzelle Sheldon (16), from Hermon, collapsed at the front gate on her first day back at school on Tuesday, Die Son reported. She was a Bergrivier hostel resident at Hoërskool Wellington and went home on weekends and during the holidays. Anzelle's parents were dumbfounded when they received the news as she had appeared in good health at their home on Monday. Her mother, Cheryl-Ann Sheldon, said her daughter had, however, complained of a chest pain last Thursday and had declined her mother's request to take painkillers. "She started crying. I told her to drink painkillers but she didn't want to. When I enquired later how she felt, she said the pain had disappeared. The last time she saw Cheryl-Ann was when the taxi came to take her to school and she said her goodbyes and gave her daughter a kiss. Anzelle's father, Salmon, said he will never forget the ominous words of the hostel mother over the telephone: “Ensure that you get to Paarl hospital as soon as possible. "When I arrived, she had already died. They probably didn't want to give me the news over the phone. She was still in her school uniform and looked like someone sleeping." Salmon, who has heart problems, said the doctor had done a sonar of Anzelle's heart and noticed some moisture surrounding it, which could have triggered the heart attack.
