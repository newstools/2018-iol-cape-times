Cape Town – Two people have appeared briefly in Cape Town courts on fraud charges related to vehicle finance. Corinne Lambert, 47, who was arrested last week, appeared in the Goodwood Magistrate's Court for allegedly submitting fraudulent documents, the SABC reported. The fictitious documents allegedly enabled her to obtain vehicle finance last year. The 54-year-old Abdul Karriem Janodien appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on similar charges. According to the Hawks, two luxury vehicles worth R1.6 million were recovered from Lambert, while another two vehicles worth R1.7 million were seized from Janodien. Lambert will apply for bail next week, while Janodien was released on bail of R10 000. Janodien will appear in court again in January. In August, four people appeared in the Vredenburg Magistrate’s Court on charges of fraud and corruption after they were allegedly implicated in the processing of fraudulent vehicle certificates in the Western Cape, the Hawks said. The Hawks said the four people were each released on R5 000 bail, with strict conditions.
