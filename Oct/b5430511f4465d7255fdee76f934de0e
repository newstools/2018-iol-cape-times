This as the dispute between the parties continues after the unions rejected an offer of a 30% increase. The employees’ unions the South African Workers Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) and Independent Municipal & Allied Trade Union (Imatu) have declared a formal dispute. The matter is going before the Bargaining Council at the end of the month for conciliation. Samwu said it demanded fewer working hours to force the City to offer a bigger percentage. At a press briefing yesterday, the City said under the current collective agreement signed in 2007, unions representing firefighters agreed to work 24-hour shifts that equate to a 56-hour week. As this is higher than the regular 40-hour work week, unions further agreed to a 22.8% allowance over and above their basic salary to account for the additional hours. Executive director for Safety and Security Richard Bosman said: “This is not a wage issue but an issue specifically relating to monthly allowances. We offered a 30% allowance, the arbitrator put forward 35% which was also rejected.” Firefighters want a 79.23% allowance, said the City. On the subject of firefighters being overworked, Chief Fire Officer Ian Schnetler said the productive time of a firefighter was 9am until 6pm. After 6pm, he said, it was their stand down time at the station to respond but they were not physically working except for one person doing reception duty. “Yes, they are on duty for a 24-hour shift but they are not always working for the full 24 hours. They work 10 shifts, after every 24-hour shift they have a day, two days or four-day break,” said Schnetler. JP Smith, Mayco member for Safety and Security, said: “There are certain financial realities we have to face. "We compete with basic infrastructure that demand City budget. The reason we honour firefighters is because we are proud of them and the work that they do. "We are in a difficult situation. We care about you, we understand the cost of living is pressurising everybody.”
