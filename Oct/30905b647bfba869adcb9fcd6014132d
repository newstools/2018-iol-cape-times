Cape Town - A suspect has been arrested for the death of Gift of the Givers volunteer Ameerodien Noordien who was shot in the head in Hanover Park last Friday. According to police, a 21-year-old man handed himself over to Philippi police on Thursday. "The circumstances surrounding the case are still under investigation and we are not ruling out the possibility that the suspect could be charged with more violent crimes," the police said. Police launched a manhunt for the shooter amid a public outcry over 20-year-old Ameerodien's death. It is believed that he was caught in the crossfire between rival gangs. Police Minister Bheki Cele attended his funeral service on Monday, where he announced the formation of an anti-gang unit for Cape Town. The day after the incident, the Gift of the Givers released an emotional for an end to the carnage on the gang-ravaged Cape Flats. "How many more innocent deaths will it take? How many more young children must die violently and tragically? How many more parents and siblings must suffer anguish before we act decisively as a nation to stem the endemic community disorder of gangsterism, drugs and violence," the statement said. The suspect is expected to appear in a Wynberg court on Monday to face a charge of murder. * Receive IOL's top stories via Whatsapp by sending your name to 0745573535. IOL
