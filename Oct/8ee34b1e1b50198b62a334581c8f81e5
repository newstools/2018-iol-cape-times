Hlumelo Biko's trial for alleged assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to his wife will go ahead following the cancellation of the mediation, the investment banker's lawyer said on Friday. "The complainant changed her mind and it was postponed for trial," said advocate Roy Barendse, News24 reported. The trial of Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko and politicianÂ Mamphela Ramphele's son is expected to start on December 5 in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court, almost a year since the complaint was laid. Police told News24 in January that the domestic violence-related assault complaint was laid on New Year's Day at Camps Bay police station. His first appearance was on January 4 and he was released on a warning, which is still in place. After his first appearance, Barendse said outside the court that Biko denied the allegations of assault against him. Mediation is available as an option for some cases. However, the process was unsuccessful in this instance.
