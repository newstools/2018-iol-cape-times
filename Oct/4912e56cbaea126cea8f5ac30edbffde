The African Centurion sporting event, a version of the International Centurion, is being hosted by Old Mutual and takes place on October 20 and 21. Head co-ordinator Lies Deneys said Robben Island was a significant landmark in South Africa’s history and that this was the last year the event would be hosted there. She said this year’s event coincided with what would have been Nelson Mandela’s 100th birthday, making the location of the event that much more powerful and significant. The 100 miles in 24 hours initiative was started in Britain in 1911 and aims to bring people from all walks of life together by using walking as a medium. It has also taken place in Australia, Malaysia, the US and the Netherlands. Deneys said that because the African Centurion champions the spirit of ubuntu and all that Madiba stood for, the organisers were donating 10% of all sponsorship raised to the Mandela Rhodes Foundation. Participants can enter solo or as a relay team of two or four walkers. There will be several support stations along the route. Supporters are welcome to join walkers. The walk costs R1695; supporters pay R950. Entries close on October 15. For more information, email Lies Deneys at info@africancenturion.com
