Cape Town – A doctor and his wife briefly appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Friday in connection with the distribution of illegal medicine worth about R1 million. Sixty-two-year-old Dr Bert Wolfgang Kirsten was arrested on Wednesday at the Kenilworth post office after he had handed in envelopes containing schedule medicines destined for the United States, the SABC reported. His 54-year-old wife, Shelley Ann Kirsten, was arrested at their home in Kenilworth, where more medicine was uncovered. TimesLive reported that a boot-load of pharmaceuticals has been seized as part of a Hawks probe into an alleged illegal medicine distribution network involving multiple countries. The Hawks said on Friday the South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau, together with the Wynberg Visible Policing Unit, “disrupted an illegal medicine distribution worth R1 million through an intelligence-led operation.” Captain Philani Nkwalase said: "Preliminary investigation led to a search and seizure at the suspect’s premises in Kenilworth. “Another suspect‚ aged 54‚ was arrested at the premises‚ upon uncovering more alleged schedule medicine and documentation of order-trails for countries such as the USA‚ UK and Sweden." The couple appeared in court on charges of contravening the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act‚ read with the Drug and Drug Trafficking Act‚ said Nkwalase. Wolfgang Kirsten was granted bail of R80 000 and his wife is out on bail of R20 000. The Hawks said more arrests can be expected.
