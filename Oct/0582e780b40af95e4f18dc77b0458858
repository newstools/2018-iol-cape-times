Three men escaped with an undisclosed amount of money in a cash-in-transit heist at a city mall on Monday, police say. The trio hit the Liberty Promenade in Mitchells Plain at about 14.30pm as the security guard was leaving the shopping centre, making off with a cash box, News24 reported. "The security guard's firearm was also taken by suspects," national police spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo said. The gang fled in a gold VW Polo Vivo with no number plates in the direction of Philippi, he said. Naidoo said police had enforced their 72-hour activation plan, which entails critical units such as the Hawks, with forensics teams and Crime Intelligence members gathering as much information as possible so that no crucial evidence is lost. No arrests have yet been made. The latest crime statistics, released last month, show more than 200 cases were recorded in the 2017/18 financial year – a 50% increase.
