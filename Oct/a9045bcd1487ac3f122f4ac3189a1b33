Annually girls are celebrated to highlight the challenges girls face while also promoting girl empowerment and the fulfilment of their human rights on International Day of the Girl. Last week, the special day was celebrated on October 11 and showcased how girls have the potential to change the world – both as the empowered girls of today and tomorrow’s workers, mothers, entrepreneurs, mentors, household heads, and political leaders. To mark the occasion, the chief commissioner of  Girl Guides South Africa, Sizeka Rensburg, together with 20 girls, (including nine from Cape Town), were invited to share a morning with Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma at the Houses of Parliament, including a special breakfast at Tuynhuys. Each year the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) celebrates with their #TeamGirl campaign and this year they focused on the power and potential of girls. WAGGGS knows girls are powerful aready, but sometimes they just need a helping hand to reach their fullest potential. That's where Girl Guides and Girl Scouts come in – which emphasises to all girls to be their own superheroes and use their power to change the world. It was an incredible morning spent with the minister and a guided tour inside Parliament. A few of the girls shared how they felt about their unique experience. Kendra Daniels, 13, said: “It was a fun experience to meet the minister and it was nice to know that there are people who really care about Girl Guides and how we can make a difference.” “I  would like to make people realise that girls and women can do better things in life and are as equal and powerful as men,” said 13-year-old Rhea Sirkisson. Andile Dlamini, 17, said she enjoyed the tour through Parliament. “It took us back to where South Africa came from and teaches us to preserve things so that future generations can be able to see it.”
