This comes after the school was supplied with a container to use as a temporary solution. The school’s 579 pupils had since March been stranded without access to books and other vital resources after their library, a classroom and a hall were destroyed in the fire. Oxford University Press Southern Africa managing director Steve Cilliers said: “Having access to books and resources found in a library is critical to a child’s development. “We are delighted to be donating the container library to Athlone North Primary.” The library was decorated by artist Izak Vollgraaff and Oxford University staff members, who also donated numerous games, toys and resources to help with the furnishings and the decor. The 12m container has been fitted with sturdy shelving, carpeting, curtains, a fan, chair for the teacher and 30 pillows for pupils to sit on. Oxford University Press Southern Africa thanked those who helped make the project happen and included AAD Trucks, who sponsored transportation of the container; Builders Warehouse Tokai, who assisted with carpeting; Crazy Chairs Woodstock, who gave the teacher’s chair; and Mia Grobler, who made the pillows. Oxford University Press is the world’s largest university press, with the widest global presence, and is also a department of the University of Oxford in the UK.
