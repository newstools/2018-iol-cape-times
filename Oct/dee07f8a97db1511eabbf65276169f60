According to the World Health Organisation, 40% of South African mothers experience symptoms of postnatal depression. Kristen Gumbrill from Fish Hoek was diagnosed with postnatal depression just after her baby was born. “It was with my first and last (child) and I was diagnosed after being in and out of the GP’s office each week because I was not feeling well.” Gumbrill said the support of her husband and sister-in-law helped her. “I hardly bonded with him for at least the first month and a half. “It’s a very difficult time as you feel like you have no bond with your baby but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Having a baby is a drastic change.” Maternity experts are calling for awareness of this illness, with it being Mental Health Awareness Month. Obstetrician and head of The Birthing Team, a maternity care programme, Dr Howard Manyonga, said while being overwhelmed is normal in the first few days after birth, it should not go on for too long. “Many women develop longer term and overwhelming feelings of sadness, irritation, fear, guilt and disconnection - the symptoms of postnatal depression.” Manyonga added that if left untreated it can prevent a healthy bond between the mother and the child. “In some cases, women have thoughts of harming themselves or their baby.” He said that once detected, depression can be addressed with counselling and, in some cases, medication.
