The City of Cape Town’s Fire and Rescue Service had its hands full at the weekend. Staff responded to a series of fires, but also a host of special service calls, specifically motor vehicle accidents, the City said in a statement on Monday. In Khayelitsha, firefighters were unfortunately forced to withdraw from the area due to a crowd becoming unruly. Between Friday and Sunday, Fire and Rescue responded to: • 34 informal settlement fires that resulted in two deaths and 104 structures affected• 18 fires at formal dwellings • 68 motor vehicle accidents• 40 pedestrians run over "It is no accident that the increase in incidents came at month end. Unfortunately, payday weekend tends to see an increase in substance abuse, which results in an increase in reckless and negligent behaviour and puts lives at risk," said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security; and Social Services, JP Smith. "We also had another incident in Khayelitsha where firefighters were forced to withdraw from the area as a result of an unruly crowd. "This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable, but becoming far too commonplace and it’s unfortunate that the instigators fail to realise the impact that their actions have." Meanwhile, the Cape Town Traffic Service arrested 54 motorists for driving under the influence of alcohol during five roadblocks in Macassar, Khayelitsha, Manenberg, Muizenberg and Fish Hoek/Ocean View at the weekend. Officers also issued 276 fines for various offences. The Metro Police Department made 16 arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol and two more for possession of drugs.
