An employee from the City of Cape Town's Electricity Department is in a critical conditionÂ following an attack that occurred around midday yesterday while staff were attending to electricity services in Gugulethu. Three City employees were targeted in the attack, but the other two are in a stable condition, the City said in a statement. The City said it "absolutely condemns the violent attack", which led to a City vehicle being damaged while another government vehicle was torched. "It is absolutely heartbreaking that these are the conditions that our staff and contractors have to work under. The City is wholly dedicated to providing top service delivery. "However, often the conditions on the ground make it impossible for City staff to perform their duties. Many of our departmental staff and contractors are risking their lives on a daily basis to provide services to our communities. "The victims of the attack are in our thoughts and we are investigating how the City can assist these workers and their families. If anyone in the community has information about this attack, please approach the South African Police Service immediately. "A City reward of up to R5 000 is on offer for anyone providing information that leads to an arrest, the confiscation of stolen or illegal goods or the handing in of illegal or stolen goods."
