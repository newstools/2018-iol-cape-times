Metrorail spokesperson Zinobulali Mihi said: “Delays of up to 60-plus minutes can be expected on most of the lines that were affected in the attacks. "However, the service has operations running. All the affected coaches have been cleared out of the respective stations and moved to the depot. So lines are cleared and operational. The delays are because we are operating with fewer coaches.” On Friday, six coaches were damaged or destroyed in three incidents in which trains were set alight. The first fire started after midday at Mbekweni station near Paarl and two further incidents followed at Firgrove and Cape Town stations. One person was reportedly shot and killed during a robbery in the Paarl incident. These incidents brought the number of coaches lost as a result of fires to 47 this year. More than 150 coaches have been lost due to fires since 2015. Regional manager Richard Walker said: “These latest incidents further reduce the already limited number of train sets. Metrorail provides the most affordable means of public transport to the poorest of the poor and the impact of these losses will again be felt by them.” Walker said they were working closely with the South African Police Service in the investigations into the incidents. Brett Herron, Mayco member for transport and urban development, said: “I am extremely concerned about this incident as our urban rail system is already operating at a fraction of the capacity it needs to service commuter demand. “Our commuter rail system is under relentless attack and it is our most vulnerable citizens who are the worst affected by the declining rail service.” Herron said the attacks appeared to be “well orchestrated” to destroy the rail service. A reward of up to R25 000 has been offered for any information that will lead to a successful conviction.
