Cape Town - A group of Bellville campus Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) students embarked on a donation collection drive to assist people left homeless during the devastating fires in Khayelitsha and Kosovo informal settlement in Philippi a week ago.This after about 900 people were displaced in Lavender Hill following a fire in the Overcome Heights informal settlement. About 309 shacks were destroyed on Thursday. Spokesperson for Disaster and Risk Management Charlotte Powell said 842 people were affected. “Sassa has been activated to provide social relief. Shoprite, Gift of the Givers and the South African Red Cross Society are assisting the community with humanitarian relief. ‘‘City services are on scene and assisting our Disaster Risk Management with the rehabilitation process,” she said. Powell said all affected by the fire were issued starter kits to rebuild dwellings. In Khayelitsha, more than 1000 people were left homeless after the fire while in Kosovo informal settlement the fire displaced about 1400 people. Shocked by these incidents, CPUT students at the Bellville campus have since collected donations for the victims of these fires. However, they said they were struggling with getting their donations to the affected areas after a truck they were to use to transport the goods was a no-show. Student spokesperson Pabi Machili said anyone wishing to assist can contact him on 0769654040 or 0733808554. While Overcome Heights residents began rebuilding their homes, Lavender Hill community activist Lucinda Evans said there were still a number of people who were sleeping unsheltered while they waited for their structures to be erected. People have been advised to drop off their donations at the Lavender High School between 9am and 4pm during the week, or contact councillor Gerry Gordon’s office on 0828250511 or contact Evans on 0734244665.
