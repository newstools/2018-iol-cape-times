Cape Town – After making the news for starting his community's first pharmacy, Thembekile Mahintsho has been inundated by calls and emails offering assistance. One of the offers came from Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo’s office, saying that they will assist him in getting licensed. This after the Cape Times published a story about the 22-year-old Cape Peninsula University of Technology accounting student who opened Joe Slovo’s first pharmacy after seeing a need for it. His pharmacy sells over-the-counter medicine, a service residents have hailed as a saving grace. Mahintsho said he has been busy with exams and hasn't been able to attend to the many calls and emails. “I have a meeting with the vice-chancellor, companies have called me and the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants also contacted me and said they want me to join a programme they have up in Joburg, as I am a deserving candidate. "Another company said they want to help me with software so I can buy stock cheaper. There was also an indigenous medicine company that wants to donate stock worth R5 000.” He said his main issue was still getting a licence and said he would gladly accept any assistance in that regard. “I am still trying to get a licence because that would help me expand and do something similar in other communities.” Mbombo’s spokesperson, Colleen Smart, said licensing for a pharmacy did not fall under their department but under the South African Pharmaceutical Council. She added that they will, however, facilitate and help him get one. “We need to make contact with them and see what is the quickest way we can help." Cape Times
