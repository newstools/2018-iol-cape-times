The City has set aside about R118.7 million for initiatives to minimise waste going to landfill sites, including for recycling and composting in the current financial year, she said. This is while the dumping of inappropriate objects in sewer systems costs the City about R270 million annually. “Instead of throwing away all our waste, we need to start thinking about how to produce less, and what can be recycled, composted and reused. “A number of interventions are in place to reduce illegally dumped waste and also to divert as much waste as possible from landfill sites. This may include recycling, composting or, as a last resort, safe landfilling.” The opening of the City's Kensington and Induland waste drop-off sites will contribute to reducing illegally dumped waste, she said. “These new drop-off sites bring the total number of City-operated drop-offs to 24, each within a 7km radius of the next.” Stats SA’s analysis of the General Household Survey 2002-2016 showed the Western Cape had the highest percentage of metropolitan households recycling waste, at 20.3%, followed by Gauteng at 12.7%. “The rapid growth in solid waste and the shortage of suitable land to dispose of waste means South Africa is running out of space for waste disposal,” Stats SA recently said.
