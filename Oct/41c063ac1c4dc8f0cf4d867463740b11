She had called for a press briefing on September 12 saying they were in possession of a “charge sheet which details the crimes committed in the fisheries sector by Ndudane, as outlined in a disciplinary hearing held on 3 September 2018 at the Department’s offices in Pretoria”. The department had slammed her, saying the document she claimed was a charge sheet against the suspended Ndudane was a hoax. Schäfer made an about-turn yesterday, saying: “It appears that the information at my disposal was incorrect and certain averments made by me were false. I apologise therefore and for the inconvenience caused to the parties involved. “Disciplinary proceedings are currently under way. The disciplinary hearing has not yet been finalised and no rulings have been made.” DAFF spokesperson Khaye Nkwanyana said: “We were extremely shocked by this juvenile play to the gallery on what was unknown to us. “To the extent that this MPL convened a press conference on such unfounded claims thereby compromising our own process without solicitation, we demand a similar press conference to be convened to withdraw and apologise.”
