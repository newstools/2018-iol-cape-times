The 2017 tender was for providing security services to about 3 000 facilities owned or used by the City, as well as various events held under its banner. The four companies are Bizstorm, Plagueless, Metro and Silvermoon, which are rendering services on a tender awarded in 2014. Eighteen companies were successful in their bid to service the City at various sites, which the four are ­opposing in terms of the application process. The court last week heard arguments from the four companies that wanted the court to review and set aside the City’s decision to declare their applications bid for the tender to be unresponsive. Their legal representative, Dirk Kotze, argued that the four companies sought an interim interdict that would prevent the City from allocating security sites to other companies or conclude contracts with them. “The applicant does not seek to review and set aside the adjudication of the other respondents as being responsive tenderers, nor their inclusion on the panels, (but) merely to set aside the rejection of their bids and to be included on the panels for which it tendered,” their papers read. In its answering affidavits, the City said the four companies were existing service providers and were well aware of its supply-chain management policy and the tender process. The matter has been postponed to tomorrow for further arguments. Cape Times
