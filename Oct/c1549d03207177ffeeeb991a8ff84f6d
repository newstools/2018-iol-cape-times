A crack in aÂ railway line left passengers stranded for hours on a long-distance train from Johannesburg to Cape Town. The crack was discovered on the railway line near Beaufort West on Wednesday morning, the SABC reported. The Shosholoza Meyl train, which is a division of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa), also has to adhere to a number of speed restrictions on the line. A passenger on the train, Andrew Blazey, said: "I've travelled with Shosholoza a few times in the past and this is regular. It's unacceptable. "If we are paying for a service, you're a service provider, so provide us with a service. We're paying for this service but it's never on time." Meanwhile, Prasa has apologised to all the passengers on board. Spokesperson Sipho Sithole said: "After it (train) left Beaufort West, there were speed restrictions on the Transnet line, which then limits the speed by which the train needs to proceed. "Then there was a crack on one of the tracks. We had to stop and call the Transnet engineers to come and inspect the tracks to check if it is safe to proceed. "We apologise to passengers on board and those that would have been meeting and greeting the passengers as they disembark at Cape Town station."
