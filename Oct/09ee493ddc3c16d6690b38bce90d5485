The Western Cape government is giving Police Minister Beki Cele 30 days to respond to a list of urgent demands. They include the deployment of more police officers to combat crime, drug abuse and gangsterism, the SABC reported on Wednesday. Premier Helen Zille said they would take the matter further if they do not receive a satisfactory response. Cele's office has confirmed that it received correspondence from Zille on Wednesday. Meanwhile, provincial Community Safety Minister Dan Plato, who is winding down his duties before taking over as mayor from Patricia de Lille, said additional policing wouldÂ improve the current work being done to combat gangsterism. "Confidence will be installed in the minds of the public if the police, in a more forceful dramatic way, begin to arrest the top drug lords, the top gang bosses, because they are the people in charge of the all gangster groupings. "They are the people that give the necessary orders and those arrested are just the runners, are just the small fry," said Plato.
