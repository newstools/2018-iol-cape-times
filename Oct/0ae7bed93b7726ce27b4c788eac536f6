CAPE TOWN – The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has announced on its social media platforms that the initiative to grant all unemployed South African citizens groceries is a scam. Sassa wrote on Twitter: “Sassa would like to warn its beneficiaries about the recent scam circulating. The below information is untrue and misleading.”       The scam claims the initiative will run from 2019 until 2020 and will grant all unemployed SA citizens a R2 200 grocery voucher. The scam then states that SA citizens should have a valid SA ID or birth certificate in order to apply for the grant, that is closing on 23 December 2018. If you've been a victim of the scam, Sassa has encouraged that you visit their offices to report the matter.
