Cape Town – While calm has returned to Witsand in Atlantis following a violent service delivery protest on Thursday, residents are demanding the release of seven protesters, including two minors, who were arrested. A woman was injured after police were forced to fire rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the protesting crowds. Protesters blockaded roads in the area with burning tyres and tree branches. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana told News24 public order police and other authorities had been on high alert over the protest in Atlantis, which is about 40km north of Cape Town. Police will continue to monitor the protests on the Witsand side of Atlantis, which borders agricultural areas. Many of Witsand's residents live in zinc shacks or wooden houses. Aside from demanding better service delivery, the protesters also sought the approval of the construction of a community hall. "The community said it needed a hall, but the City (of Cape Town) didn't take it seriously," said SA National Civic Organisation leader Thobile Maseti. Maseti told the SABC they are concerned about the seven people who were arrested. "The community is saying we can call the protest off, but one of the things that are worrying the community now is the seven people who were arrested… because they feel that those people did not do anything wrong." A pamphlet doing the rounds also called for, among other things, the resignation of a number of councillors and municipal managers, that locals get contract work instead of outsiders, and that housing shortages be addressed. One of the councillors whose resignation was called for in the pamphlet, titled "AtlantisShutdown", is the DA's Suzette Little. "I'm very concerned about it," Little said of the protests and clashes with police.
