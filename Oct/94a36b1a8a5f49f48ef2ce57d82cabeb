A warrant dodger’s luck ran out when he was caught, of all places, at court for outstanding warrants totalling just short of R175 000. The 22-year-old taxi driver from Bellville South, ranked number 13 on the Top 100 Taxi scofflaws list with 61 outstanding warrants, is also an unlicensed driver, the City of Cape Town said in a statement on Friday. "This week, members of the City’s Operation Reclaim Task Team learnt that the suspect was in custody at Goodwood Prison and would be appearing in court. "So yesterday (Thursday), as he was released on R500 bail in Bellville on an attempted arson charge, officers had the handcuffs ready to arrest him for his outstanding warrants. "He was denied bail at the Parow Municipal Court, while bail amounts at three other courts for offences in those areas add up to R10 000. The suspect will remain at Goodwood Prison until his next court appearance," the City said.
