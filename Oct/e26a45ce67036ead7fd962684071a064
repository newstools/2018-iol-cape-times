The plan is to assist girls by preventing from them missing out on school because of their menstrual cycle. “Every month, our database of recipients grows as more schools and NPOs discover the benefits of Subz washable sanitary packs,” said Sue Barnes, founder of Subz Pants and Pads and its NPO extension, Project Dignity. “We constantly work to meet the need, but the reality is that without corporate sponsorship we just can't reach schools as quickly as we would like.” She added that young women in disadvantaged communities would often miss up to a week of school every month because of a lack of sanitary pads, sacrificing vital educational input for the sake of deserved dignity. “We are incredibly grateful for the generous Ipsos donation. We have been able to undertake activations at schools countrywide, educating 1000 young women about puberty and distributing the Subz packs.” Ipsos is a global market research and consulting firm with a presence in 89 countries. Tessa Schoeman of Ipsos Laboratories said: “The importance of educating girls should not be underestimated. Research has shown that girls who stay in school longer are less likely to contract HIV, more likely to marry later and have fewer children. "Girls attending school also seek education for their own children, thereby improving an entire nation’s education.” Project Dignity was also able to distribute a further 885 packs of Subz Pants and Pads because of the support of individual donors. The recipients included four KwaZulu-Natal schools as well as NPOs such as Sizokhula in KwaMashu, Hands of Luv in Cape Town and Sonke Gender Justice, as well as two Eastern Cape-based NPOs.
