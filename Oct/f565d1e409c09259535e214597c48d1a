They received 3 650 votes out of 8 863. They were competing against the SA Students Congress (Sasco) and Pan Africanist Student Movement of Azania (Pasma). The party believes the students’ desire for change was the reason behind the whirlwind of victories across university campuses. The EFFSC also came top at UCT, CPUT Bellville and Mowbray campuses. The student party also won the majority of SRC seats for the first time at the University of Johannesburg. They claimed victory at KwaZulu-Natal’s Durban University of Technology, the University of Zululand and the Mangosuthu University of Technology. The much-anticipated results at the District Six campus were released yesterday by chief electoral officer Yoliswa Khusu after a week of delays in counting votes. Counting only commenced on Friday and concluded on Saturday. The EFFSC claimed four seats, followed by Pasma with two seats (2644 votes) and Sasco with two seats (2369 votes). EFF Student Command chairperson in District Six, Sipho Mokoena, said: “The students have spoken. They needed change and that change is the EFFSC. They trust us because of our groundwork. ‘‘We have been assisting the students, especially the ones from disadvantaged backgrounds, since day one. The students claimed Sasco did not do anything for them besides hosting parties. We want to fulfil the promises made to students that weren't delivered.” He said the party wanted to start a programme which would focus on student poverty and academic excellence. Sasco chairperson at District Six campus, Lutho Runeli said they submitted their objections yesterday. “We can confidently say we did our job and fulfilled our promises, maybe not all of them, because of the term which is not enough.”
