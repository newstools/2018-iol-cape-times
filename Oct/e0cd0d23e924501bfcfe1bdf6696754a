Sunflower Day last month saw South Africans buying and displaying their Tubes of Hope or Topes. The Sunflower Day campaign is one of the fund’s major fund-raising initiatives, which leverages the sale of Topes to raise money for the recruitment of blood stem cell donors. It gives hope to individuals with life-threatening blood diseases. A major driver of these sales is the schools’ competition. Schools across the country spread awareness about bone marrow donation as part of the fund's schools’ competition. Fifty-five schools were judged by an independent panel based on the number of Topes bought in relation to the number of learners at the school and their display of gees on the day. The theme of this year’s campaign was “there is a hero in all of us”. Kirstenhof Primary School claimed first place, Worcester Primary School came in second and Refitlhile Primary School in Mpumalanga third. Each school won a trophy donated by Woolf’s Trophies and Engravers, vouchers from Bargain Books and sporting equipment vouchers from Disa Sports. Sunflower Fund chief executive Alana James said the buzz on social media and the support from partners, patients, schools and communities was truly inspiring. “South Africa has an ethnically diverse source of potential stem cell donors, who are committed to helping save lives no matter what their age,” she said. Topes will be on sale until the end of October at Pick * Pay stores, selected independent pharmacies, online at Zando or from The Sunflower Fund. Proceeds from the campaign will enable The Sunflower Fund to continue to recruit more blood stem cell donors on to the The Sunflower Fund’s stem cell registry.
