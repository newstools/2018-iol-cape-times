Jonathan Cupido’s crime spree started last October when he tried to break into the house of Daniel and Maria Marais in the middle of the night. Daniel, 78, was sleeping when Maria, 79, noticed Cupido standing outside the bedroom window. Maria awoke her husband, and Cupido smashed the window with a rock before throwing rocks at Daniel and stabbing him with a garden fork. Daniel managed to wrestle the fork from Cupido who then tried to hit him with an axe but Daniel managed to fend that off before Cupido fled. Two months later, Cupido broke into Elizabeth van Zyl’s house when she not home by forcing open the back door and security gate. He made off with a laptop, wine, an iron and a kettle. In December last year, Cupido broke into Angelique Hofsta’s house while she was also not home, and made off with a man’s watch, two pairs of sneakers, jewellery and T-shirts. On New Year’s Eve, Cupido’s robbery modus operandi turned fatal when he broke into 81-year-old Josephus Oosthuizen’s house and severely beat him. “The deceased had facial bone fractures and deep scalp bruising on the left side of his skull. “They discovered the deceased in his bedroom, severely injured but still alive. He was rushed to hospital but died there on January 5 this year. “The post-mortem examination performed on January 11 determined “head injury and the consequences thereof” as the cause of death, the State’s papers read.
