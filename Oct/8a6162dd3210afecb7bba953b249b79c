As the Gamka Dam has been empty for years, the region around Beaufort West has long depended on underground water and reclaimed treated water. But boreholes supplying the area have also begun to run dry. James-Brent Styan, the spokesperson for Western Cape Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell, said the province had developed a mass water reclamation plant in Beaufort West in 2011 due to concerns over the water situation in the town. “That plant provides about 20% of the water to the town. The rest is provided by more than 42 boreholes. About 10 have dried up, but invariably this is due to other boreholes with higher yields that have been drilled in close proximity,” he said. Old non-potable water donated to the town has been, instead of simply discarded, put into the system to be treated and used, he added. “The area is a summer rainfall region and we remain hopeful for rain in weeks and months to come. We call on the public and travellers through the area to use water as sparingly as possible,” Styan said. Beaufort West businessman Freddie Brand said the situation was desperate: “Yesterday (on Tuesday) there were areas with no water. The municipality distributed five-litre bottles of water to the community.” The scorching temperatures added to pressure on water supplies. “It really is difficult for residents. Most people are coping. It is very hot as well. Normally we have temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees,” Brand said, "but recently the area experienced temperatures around 39 degrees." From September, the municipality resolved to implement further water restrictions, with the monthly household allowance reduced to 10 kilolitres. Cape Times
