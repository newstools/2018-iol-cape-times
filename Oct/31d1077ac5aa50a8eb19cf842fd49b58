TNPA said Cape Town has been plagued recently by weather related disruptions and high swell conditions, at times impacting on port operations and the use of pilot boats to transfer marine pilots on to and off vessels. Testing of the marine helicopter took place between September 28 and October 5 at the port, using a helicopter that services the Port of Durban. Port of Cape Town Harbour Master Captain Alex Miya, who recently transferred from the Port of Durban, said Richards Bay and Durban are the only ports in TNPA’s complementary port system which use helicopters to transfer marine pilots. “Our recent successful test exercise indicated that this is a viable service to offer at the Port of Cape Town,” Miya said. At a recent customer forum in Cape Town, TNPA chief operating officer Nozipho Mdawe said a fully-fledged feasibility study is being undertaken and TNPA will be engaging with customers to determine the best approach. “The process includes engaging with major customers to establish their level of interest and to test whether the service cost would be acceptable,” she said. Mdawe added that two options are being explored. The first involves stationing one of the existing TNPA helicopters in Cape Town to service the provincial ports, while the second entails partnering with a private helicopter company to render the service when swell conditions dictate or when there are insufficient pilot boats to meet the number of vessel calls. The Port of Cape Town is also striving to replace two of its work boats by 2019/20 and a request has been made to bring forward the replacement of two tugs and two launches to 2019/20, instead of 2020/21, in order to meet industry needs.
