Striking MyCiTi workers called on the EFF to assist them in their fight for better pay, but without any luck. On Monday, about 1 000 MyCiTi employees, including drivers, security guards and tellers, embarked on an unprotected strike, demanding, among others, better wages and working conditions. The strike continued for a second day on Tuesday and employees called on the EFF to help them make their demands a reality. EFF regional secretary Banzi Dambuza said they tried to engage with City representatives but nothing transpired. “We will wait until someone comes to talk to us,” Dambuza said. Mayco member for transport Brett Herron said some of the bus drivers who took part in the unprotected strike have slowly reported for duty, but the majority of the MyCiTi routes are still not operational. Herron said the bus drivers are employed by vehicle operating companies (VOCs) and not the City. The City has long-term contracts with the VOCs to operate the MyCiTi bus routes across Cape Town. Herron has urged the VOCs and their employees to meet as soon as possible. “The VOCs have informed the City of Cape Town that some of the bus drivers who have participated in the unprotected strike are slowly reporting for duty. "However, the majority of the MyCiTi routes are still not operational. Commuters should please take note that the service will only run according to schedule once all bus drivers have returned to work,” Herron said. Commuters can contact the Transport Information Centre 24/7 on 0800 65 64 63 for the latest information regarding the service or follow @MyCiTibus on Twitter or visit the Facebook page, MyCiTi Integrated Rapid Transit System.
