The event, hosted by the Surfing Emporium Surf School in Muizenberg, will also see former Proteas cricketer Morne Morkel and comedian Nik Rabinowitz support the initiative. Emporium owner Roxy Davis said the disabled members of the South African national surf team and disabled Hout Bay surfer Anthony Smyth, who recently won his division at a world surfing contest, would also attend. “The aim of the event is to show that South Africans with disabilities can take up sports such as surfing and to create awareness of our South African National Adaptive Surfing Team, who will represent the country at the World Adaptive Surfing Championships in December,” said Davis. She said Smyth heads the Adaptive Surfing Western Cape and won the Open division in the Upper Limb Stand category at the US Open Adaptive Surf Championships held in California, US, from October 5-7. Adaptive surfing teaches skills to children and adults with physical and mental disabilities as well as terminal illnesses.
