In a notice issued by the municipality on Saturday, it said a truck would deliver water to Villiersdorp. “Due to electricity being off we cannot pump water into the area,” it said. Last Thursday, an Eskom transformer was vandalised in Siyayanzela in Grabouw, putting the water supply under pressure. Grabouw was rocked by protests on Thursday, with the N2 having had to be closed after protesters pelted stones at motorists. The municipality has suffered a number of setbacks relating to water delivery due to constant suspected vandalism. By the end of September the municipality said eight pumps had been vandalised. An alarm, pumps, lights and electric panels were stolen. At the time the cost of the damage was estimated to be around R60 000. Staf
