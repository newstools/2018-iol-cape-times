CAPE TOWN – Pick n Pay’s Smart Shoppers will soon be able to use their Smart Shopper points directly at the store’s till points. This means that customers will no longer have to switch their points to cash at the Smart Shopper kiosk or online first. “We talk to our Smart Shoppers regularly and always take their views into consideration to make their experience that much better. They told us that being able to redeem points at the till was the one thing they really wanted from the programme to make their shopping trip easier. So from 24 October they’ll be able to do just that,” said John Bradshaw, head of Marketing at Pick n Pay. Pick n Pay cashiers will prompt customers who have accumulated more than R5 if they’d like to use their points to pay towards their purchase, although customers can pay with any amount they have on their registered Smart Shopper card. “This is just another step towards making things easier, simpler and faster for our customers,” said Bradshaw. Other enhancements to the programme include the introduction of the Card-less Swipe functionality. Customers who have forgotten their Smart Shopper card at home, or choose to go card-less, can now scan the QR code from the Pick n Pay mobile app at the till point. The weekly Just for You personalised discounts, which can now be loaded directly from emails, remains popular with customers. "During the last six months, the programme’s seven million Smart Shoppers were offered R2.4 billion in personalised discounts, and redemption of personalised vouchers grew by 15 percent. “We also launched a Pet, Baby and Wine Club where we offer further discounts and points for our customers with a specific interest in these categories. Apart from great deals, members are also invited to attend exclusive events as part of their Club membership," said Bradshaw. Before the end of the year, Smart Shopper customers will also be able to earn points at BP service stations when refuelling. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
