The Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) has appointed a new chief financial officer (CFO). Wayne de Wet is a qualified chartered accountant and holds a bachelor of accounting science degree and honours in accounting science. De Wet is responsible for, among other duties, developing and implementing the CTICC’s financial strategies, strategic leadership of finance and supply-chain management, and growth and resource management within the finance department. CTICC chief executive Julie-May Ellingson said they look forward to having De Wet as part of the team. “We are very pleased to have someone of De Wet’s calibre join our dynamic team. De Wet comes with a wealth of experience and knowledge, having worked in the tourism and hospitality sectors, as well as several state entities and the private sector. "He also comes at an exciting time in the development of the CTICC with the addition of CTICC 2 and we know that his expertise, experience and leadership will help steer the company in an even more positive direction,” Ellingson said. De Wet said he was looking for a new challenge to expand his experience. “Being in finance allows me to work across many sectors applying similar principles. So far my experience in the hospitality sector allowed me to be more involved in the various areas of operations and not purely limited to finance,” he said.
