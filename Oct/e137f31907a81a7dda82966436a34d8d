He spoke to the Cape Times as the country celebrated what would have been Sisulu’s centenary yesterday, with events held across the country. Goldberg said: “I am full of admiration for the life of my comrade. Her support of Walter while he was in prison. I have admiration for her staunch support for the struggle to end apartheid. Under the awful oppression of her family and parents, she was always mobilising to oppose apartheid.” Goldberg said Sisulu would have been appalled by the racism that still existed in South Africa. He said alongside her husband, Walter Sisulu, she acted on her ideal of human rights throughout her life. The government, led by Jeff Radebe, the Minister of Energy and the chairperson of the centenary of both Albertina Sisulu and Nelson Mandela, joined the Sisulu family in commemorating the day yesterday. The celebrations were concluded with a symbolic walk from MaSisulu’s home to Shanti Family Clinic, where MaSisulu worked for many years with Dr Abu Baker Asvat. A stop was made at Orlando West Children’s Library, which was fully renovated and reopened by the Sisulu family. Speaking in Orlando West, Soweto, where government leaders and Sisulu’s family celebrated Sisulu’s life and legacy, ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini said Sisulu would be dismayed by the state of affairs within the ANC as she was against division. ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte, who was among the so-called “Ma Sisulu Girls”, credited her for getting her to join the Struggle. “We were young girls in our 20s. We were recruited by her into the movement. “She was an incredible organiser and she had no fear of any challenge. She was the longest banned person in this country, for 18 years, and she was the first person to serve a 90-day detention,” she said. Cape Times
