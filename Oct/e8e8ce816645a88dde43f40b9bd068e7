Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said on Wednesday the incident is still under investigation after suspects gained access to a farmhouse. “An incident that occurred on a farm near Wellington on October 5 at about 8.45pm (is still under investigation). Five suspects armed with firearms gained access at the farm premises, pointed a firearm at a complainant and assaulted her husband,” Traut said. The suspects made off with a shotgun from the safe and several other items from the home before fleeing the scene, according to Traut.
