Cape Town – Two Bothasig police station detectives have been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for corruption, theft and defeating or obstructing the course of justice. The sentences against Zandisile Ruka, 38, and Thulile Ruka, 35, were suspended for five years. They were arrested by members of the Western Cape Anti-Corruption Unit while attending an on-duty parade in April last year. The detectives were instructed to investigate a case of theft and traced a suspect from whom they recovered R45 000 in cash. They failed to arrest the suspect and kept the money for themselves. They recorded in the case docket that the suspect could not be traced, and that the docket had been closed. Both lost their jobs following a disciplinary hearing and have to repay the R45 000 to the complainant in the theft case. In August, five police officers based in the West Coast town of Vredenburg have been arrested on suspicion of crimes including falsifying information and colluding with members of the public to have drugs transported.
