The Women’s Legal Centre (WLC) had argued that by not recognising Muslim marriages under common law, Muslim women were not afforded legal protection and did not have access to the courts to assert their rights. Yesterday, WLC director Seehaam Samaai said they had not yet been notified of the state’s intention to appeal and would be able to comment only once they had seen its papers. Justice and Correctional Services spokesperson Mukoni Ratshitanga said President Cyril Ramaphosa had consulted with the Ministry of Justice and other members of the executive, and they planned to appeal for three reasons. First, the government was already in the process of researching an omnibus law that would deal with the recognition and dissolution of all religious marriages. Secondly, the Western Cape High Court’s finding had implications on all other religious marriages which have not been registered as secular marriages in terms of the Marriage Act. “Lastly, a Mrs R Essau, who has lodged an appeal with the Constitutional Court because the court did not give immediate relief in a marriage, has already (had it) dissolved in terms of Islamic Law,” said Ratshitanga. “For these primary reasons, the president and the minister of justice have taken a decision to appeal the judgment of the full Bench. "They will do so upon the basis that they remain committed to complete the process that they have already commenced, and that is to pass one law governing all religious marriages. "The issues presented with respect to religious marriages are complex and wide-ranging, and any legislation must be preceded by what will likely be a lengthy and vigorous public participation process, which of necessity will have to involve all religious groups in the country,” Ratshitanga said.
