The Oudtshoorn municipality will consider using its R30 million drought funding for groundwater development projects in Jan Fourieskraal or Waterkloof. This will entail the drilling, equipping and pumping through a 6km pipeline to a modular water treatment plant into the Klein Karoo Rural Water Supply System (KKRWSS) pipeline at a total estimated cost of R30 million. The municipality is deciding how to utilise R30 million drought funding received from the national government. This funding is part of R974 million allocated to provincial governments towards disaster recovery programmes in the Western Cape, from National Treasury and the National Disaster Management Centre. The funding came after the municipality sought help from the Western Cape provincial government to alleviate the water crisis the town is currently facing. The town’s main water resource, the Koos Raubenheimer dam is 44% full. The town council declared a local state of disaster due to critical water shortages last month when the dam level was just above 30%. “The council welcomes the funding with great gratitude, and I believe the community of the Greater Oudtshoorn is as appreciative of this relief,” Mayor Colan Sylvester said.
