They form part of a 30km and a 90km run ending tomorrow. It is hosted by the Singita Grumeti Fund and the South African non-profit organisation BRAVE. The organisations aim to raise about R3million needed to run programmes to educate future female leaders in conservation. The run will also raise awareness of the challenges facing girls and women living in nearby African communities, and seek sustainable solutions. BRAVE founder India Baird, who is also running, said: “Being a part of this first ever BRAVE-Singita run will change the face of conservation in this area by creating opportunities for girls to become leaders in the field.” BRAVE creates girl leaders by supporting girl-led initiatives and building a network of women and girl leaders across Africa. Singita Grumeti Fund community outreach programme manager Frida Mollel said: “We are here to speak to girls and tell them you have the right to a good education and to stand firm. We want to inspire them, to give them power and energy.” Part of the donations raised will go toward the Singita Grumeti Fund’s conservation work in the Serengeti, and part to help create opportunities for local girls to develop as leaders. The runners will also have the opportunity to engage with local girls and learn more about the Singita Grumeti Fund’s anti-poaching strategy. They will visit the canine unit and meet the elite anti-poaching team. Runners were asked to donate $15000 (more than R215000) each to directly contribute to programmes run by Singita Grumeti and BRAVE. The event forms part of Singita’s new collection of conservation safaris called “Safaris With A Purpose”. Cape Times
