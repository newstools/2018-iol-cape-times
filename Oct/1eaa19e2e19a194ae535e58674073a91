With the high temperatures, ER24 is urging people to be cautious. Many people will soon be heading towards their holiday destinations and spending large amounts of time outdoors. Heat injuries can occur when our bodies lose necessary body fluids when we produce sweat. These injuries can be severe and can lead to death if untreated.  The signs and symptoms of heat injuries are: Cramps, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, fainting and seizures. A few tips to beat the heat * Stay well hydrated by drinking a lot of water. * Keep a close eye on babies, the elderly and children. Ensure they stay well hydrated as well. * Remember to ensure pets have a cool place to relax and cool, clean water to drink as well. * Try to keep out of direct sunlight. * Wear the appropriate clothing and ensure you use sunscreen. * Limit participation in outdoor activities. If you plan on participating in outdoor activities, ensure you rest and keep well hydrated. * If you are going to spend time in a pool, ensure your safety and that of children around you. * Do not leave children and pets in a vehicle, even with a window open. ER24 can be contacted at 084 124 for any medical emergency. Cape Times
