On Friday, which is World Smile Day, Operation Smile ambassadors, extreme adventurer David Grier and his ultra-challenge partner Andrew Stuart, will hike up Table Mountain for the cause. World Smile Day is a global event in which people help “improve the world, one smile at a time”. The group will depart from the base of Platteklip Gorge at 6am and aim to watch a beautiful Cape Town sunrise and create a unique “human smile” at the summit. They have called on the public to encourage friends and family to join them at a cost of R50, and to remember to wear comfortable walking shoes and to bring a headlamp. “I can’t think of a more appropriate manner and day to tell South Africans and the rest of the world that we’re striving for a world in which everyone is able to smile,” said Grier. Through numerous epic adventures, such as running the entire length of the Great Wall of China, and running across India, Grier has helped to increase awareness for Miles for Smiles - a Cipla Foundation initiative - which raises funds for corrective surgeries. Operation Smile South Africa (Ossa) is a medical non-profit organisation dedicated to providing safe, effective and timeous surgery to children and adults born with cleft lip and/or palate. Operation Smile South Africa country manager Lauren Bright said: “World Smile Day is very special to us as it’s an opportunity to acknowledge the amazing work done so far, but more importantly, to look forward to a world in which all people have access to surgery and the right to a smile.” Ossa recently returned from a medical mission to Quelamane, Mozambique, where together with a team of volunteers they brought life-changing surgeries to 76 patients in just four-and-a-half days. “This is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many more patients in Mozambique, South Africa and across the continent who need our help, and we won’t stop until they all have a new smile,” said Grier.
