To offer support to over 100 000 South Africans affected with cancer annually, Cancer Buddies, a free and easily accessible peer-to-peer buddy support network, was established to support and empower patients, caregivers and families. Currently, cancer organisations offering emotional support to sufferers predominately cater to English and Afrikaans speakers. Brett Simpson of Cancer Buddies, who was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma cancer in 2007, said: “As a non-profit organisation dealing with cancer, a disease that affects one in four South Africans in one way or another, we have a responsibility to bridge the language gap and branch out to lower-income areas that could use our support. “Like so many others, the impact of my cancer diagnosis was an emotional and psychological roller-coaster. For the first time in my life I was faced with the fear of death and, more surprisingly, my fear of wholehearted living. “When I had the opportunity to meet with a cancer survivor, someone who understood my fears, insecurities and my specific cancer because they had walked in my shoes, it changed my perspective. “I then understood that cancer doesn’t mean death and I was able to shift my negative thoughts and nurture the hope I had left and use it to heal.” The campaign was launched this month and has so far raised more than R13 000 towards the goal of R100 000, with contributions from 12 donors. “With the funds raised from our BackaBuddy campaign we will be able to employ a retired oncology nurse, Marta Booi, for 12 months to answer our toll-free helpline in isiXhosa, translate our website, and adapt our social media strategy to include both English and isiXhosa content. “The funds will also keep Cancer Buddies operational for the next four months,” Simpson added.
