The left flank of the veld fire in the Groot Winterhoek mountains near Tulbagh in the Cape Winelands has flared up, while the flames on the right fire line have been brought under control. The vegetation fire had been caused by lightning on Monday night. Jo-Anne Otto, from the Cape Winelands District Municipality, said aerial support has been requested to combat the flare-up, the SABC reported. "Wind conditions have subsided, allowing the helicopters access. Aerial support and ground teams are working together to contain the fire. "The fire on the right flank is currently contained. Firefighting crews will continue with fire suppression and mopping up operations throughout the day,” Otto said. Meanwhile, fire authorities in the Southern Cape said around 60 percent of the wildfires in Vermaaklikheid, near Heidelberg, has been extinguished. This is thanks to additional resources from the SANDF, municipalities and fire-fighting organisations. At least eight homes were gutted in the blaze, which started at the weekend, while a Working on Fire helicopter pilot died after his aircraft crashed in the area on Tuesday. Working on Fire managing director Trevor Abrahams said a Civil Aviation Authority team is going through the debris. “They are on-site and busy with their work and obviously we will await their outcome in terms of determining the likely cause of the accident.”
