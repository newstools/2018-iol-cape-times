The City of Cape Town's Gang and Drug Task Team conducted stop-and-search crime prevention operations in Manenberg and Hanover Park on Monday. The operations, some of which are in response to tip-offs from ward councillors and community members, are conducted several times a month in an attempt to curb drug dealing and clamping down on illegal firearms. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, and Health JP Smith said they confiscated a firearm in Hanover Park, the SABC reported. "That was as a result of the shot spotter system, the gun-fire detection system that we use. About 70 percent of the firearms we're taking at the moment comes from that system, which runs in Hanover Park and Manenberg. "We're negotiating to expand it because we want it present in at least five or six more of our gang hot spots. The rest of it is random stop-and-searches, searching people who fit the profile."
