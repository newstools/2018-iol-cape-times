Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu spent his 87th birthday in hospital last Sunday but, having been discharged, he will be able to celebrate his wife Leah's birthday on Sunday, with a double celebration most likely. Tutu, who has battled with prostate cancer for more than two decades, was taken to hospital last week and underwent a number of tests. "The Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation wishes to thank all who have sent messages and prayers, including on social media, for the Arch's swift return to his feet," the foundation said in a statement on Friday. "The foundation's board of directors and staff wish Mrs Tutu a very happy birthday, and the Archbishop a full recovery to sustainable good health." Meanwhile, fellow anti-apartheid activist Andrew Mlangeni was still in hospital but was recovering well. "He is much better," his son, Sello Mlangeni, told News24. Mlangeni, one of the Rivonia trialists, was admitted to a Cape Town hospital on October 3. Monday will mark 29 years since Mlangeni was released from Robben Island. He and Denis Goldberg are the last survivors of the Rivonia Trial.
