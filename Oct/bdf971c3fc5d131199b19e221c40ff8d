An innocent man was gunned down in broad daylight and another injured at a shopping centre in Elsies River. The 35-year-old man, only known as “Arnie”, was found with his body riddled with bullets in a pool of his own blood at Avonwood Square. An unidentified 25-year-old male was also injured during the shooting. Arnie was known for cleaning roads and yards in the area. It is not clear what the motive for the shooting was. According to a witness, who asked not to be identified, Arnie was just a regular guy. “He was a normal guy. He had his flaws, but did not deserve to die in such a gruesome manner,” says the witness. “I don’t know who could have wanted him dead. He was one of the guys who knew everyone and was never shy to ask for an odd job or assist in any way. He was not a gangster. "These gangsters in Elsies River are too trigger happy now, they kill anyone. It may be he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel André Traut confirmed the shooting incident and says no arrests have been made yet. “The circumstances surrounding a murder and attempted murder are being investigated following an incident on Thursday around 2pm,” he says. “A 35-year-old man was shot and killed and a 25-year-old man was wounded at the Avonwood Square shopping centre. The suspects fled and are yet to be arrested.” Daily Voice
