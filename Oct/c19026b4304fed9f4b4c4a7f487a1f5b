The City of Cape Town has urged motorists to check their car licence discs to see if it is up for renewal. This was due to licence renewal notices not having been printed and posted by the Road Traffic Management Corporation for the month of October. "This affects motorists whose discs expired on 30 September 2018 and that must be renewed on or before 22 October 2018," the City said in a statement on Friday. "Although this situation is outside of our control and not of our making, we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience. "We advise that it is possible that the licence renewal process at our walk-in offices may take a few minutes longer due to the renewal notices not having been sent," said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Finance, Johan van der Merwe." Members of the public are also able to renew their licences online by going to www.capetown.gov.za/vehiclelicensing to register and to make their payments. Proof of residence and a copy of the ID of the vehicle owner are required when applying for renewals. The proof of residence and the copy of ID can be scanned in and sent as an attachment if the application is completed online. Allow at least 10 days for online licence disk renewals, the City cautioned, subject to the postal service being in full operation.
