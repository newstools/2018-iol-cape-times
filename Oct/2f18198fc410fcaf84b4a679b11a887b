The SCA majority judges recently held that adult extension severely restricts the right of the media to impart information and infringes an open justice principle. The SCA did, however, extend identity protection to all children involved in criminal proceedings. The court declared a section of the Criminal Procedure Act constitutionally invalid in that protection did not extend to child victims at criminal proceedings. It has ordered Parliament to change things within 24 months. The case was initiated by the Centre for Child Law (CCL), which argued children involved in criminal cases, whether as victims, witnesses or offenders, should have ongoing protection after they turn 18. The case drew from Zephany Nurse, who was kidnapped from Groote Schuur Hospital in 1997 when she was just two days old. Nurse was reunited with her biological family when she was 17, and in 2016 the court granted an urgent application protecting Zephany’s identity. The CCL said, however, the order did not extend to when a child turned 18. Several media houses, as well as the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services and the National Director of Public Prosecutions, were cited as respondents. The majority SCA judges held that: “There will be cases where obviously protection is necessary but, as the media respondents have fairly argued, there are dangers in being over-zealous and casting the net too wide,” the SCA found. “The CCL is of the view that for children to fully benefit from having their identity protected when they are under 18 years, this protection should extend to after they turn 18 years of age to prevent significant and life-long harms." Justice and Correctional Services spokesperson Steve Mahlangu said they were studying the judgment.
