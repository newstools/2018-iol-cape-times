Two pupils have been stabbed and killed in separate incidents in the province this week. Western Cape Education Department (WCED) spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said a Grade 9 Sinako Secondary School pupil in Khayelitsha was stabbed on Tuesday at the school during the interval, reportedly by another pupil. The pupil was rushed to hospital but succumbed to his wounds yesterday. In another incident, Hammond said a Grade 8 Stellenzicht Secondary School pupil in Stellenbosch was reportedly stabbed outside the school premises after leaving the school during the interval. “The learner reportedly ran onto the school premises where he sadly succumbed to his wounds. We are unsure at this stage of the motive in each incident,” she said. In March, in what is believed to have been a gang-related incident, three pupils were allegedly stabbed by a matric pupil at Atlantis Secondary School. The injured children were in grades 11 and 12.
