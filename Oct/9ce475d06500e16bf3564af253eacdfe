Molosi was shot near his home on his way back from a governing body meeting at Concordia High School. ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs said Molosi was well loved by Knysna communities. “Our current candidate, Thando Charles Matika, is also an activist and was mentored by Molosi. “There was a community process when electing the candidate and he was overwhelmingly supported.” Jacobs said their candidate was focused on development and exposing corruption and nepotism in the municipality. “Inequality is rife there. The municipality doesn’t do a lot for African and coloured communities. Our candidate is a champion for development for them,” he said. The DA candidate is Sharron Hartnick. DA East regional chairperson Jaco Londt said: “We chose Sharron because as a resident of Concordia for 40 years, she knows the community well and understands what its needs are. “She will be a good ward candidate and serve her community with passion and dedication should she win the by-election today.” The bail application for the three men, including councillor Velile Waxa, accused of killing Molosi is also set for today.
