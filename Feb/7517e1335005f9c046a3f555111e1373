The story of the Lavender Hill mother who killed her abusive tik-addicted son in 2007 received national attention and is Joshua's second feature following his success with Noem My Skollie. Joshua said: “I was hesitant to do another biographical movie, but the producers had me meet with Ellen and her story resonated with me. "The audience did not have any real idea of this pandemic and their response was amazing, as our goal was to show how this woman was failed by a system rather than villainise her son.” The movie covers the stormy relationship of Pakkies, played by Jill Levenberg, and her 
drug addict son, Abie 
Pakkies, played by Jarrid Geduld. Covering the events that led to Pakkies killing her son, as well as the court case, the films attempts to prove Pakkies had no choice and covers how she was failed after seeking help. Producer Schalk Burger said their feature was screened in the Pan African Cinema section of the festival. “Our movie was in the running for the audience award and we came in 21st out of 176 movies, some of which were big budget productions.” The movie will be released in cinemas countrywide on September 7.
