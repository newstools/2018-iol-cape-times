Yoshi has been back in the ocean now for 64 days, and she is making great progress up the West Coast, the Two Oceans Aquarium said on Tuesday. She has travelled 1 860km already, and is currently about 130km offshore from the Hardap region of Namibia. Yoshi is actually in line with Sesriem – straight west, and heading towards Walvis Bay.   On 16 December the aquarium released Yoshi the loggerhead turtle back into the ocean. She was the size of a dinner plate when she first arrived via a fishing boat, in 1997. Given Yoshi’s age, her excellent health, and her display of certain behaviours, it was decided that it is time for her to be released back into the ocean. Weighing 183kg, Yoshi was released 27 nautical miles south west of Hout Bay in 20.6°C water. Yoshi was fitted with a satellite tag and we’ll update you on her whereabouts right here, when and where we can.
