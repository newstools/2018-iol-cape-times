This was the message from newly appointed ANC treasurer-general Paul Mashatile, who spoke at the Raging Bull Awards 
yesterday. Mashatile was the keynote speaker at the event, which honoured stars of the unit trust industry and this year included an investment summit that was open to the public. The awards were established to recognise the managers of retail unit trust funds that consistently earn good returns for local 
investors. Mashatile said the new leadership of the ANC would focus heavily on restoring the economy to not only attract investors, but grow small businesses to create jobs, and reduce levels of poverty and inequality. “Just before we left for Davos, one of the things we had to fix was Eskom. That will happen with all state-owned entities, not just Eskom. Where there is a problem we will fix it.  We have come to the conclusion there are a lot of South Africans who have integrity, and we must get them on board. "Gone are the days where ministers will appoint friends to boards. We want the right people to run things properly. We are positive investors are looking forward to working with us,” Mashatile said. He said the government would deal decisively with corruption. “When we were at (the ANC's 54th national) conference, we debated a lot of things, and the president emphasised the need for economic recovery we want to grow the economy, increase food production, make sure of food security,” Mashatile said. The leadership had also agreed on changing the structure of ownership patterns, to include more black people, and support small businesses. In many countries economies are driven by small businesses, and there is a strong focus on supporting emerging entrepreneurs. “There is no way the ANC will encourage land grabs, that is not going to happen,” he said.
