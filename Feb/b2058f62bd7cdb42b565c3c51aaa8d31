The ANC said on Monday it has "noted reports of number of marches planned to its headquarters, Luthuli House, in Johannesburg today". "Whilst, the ANC has not received any formal notification of any marches to Luthuli House, we trust that any grouping intending to march today has the necessary permissions in line with the law and regulations."' Several #ZumaMustGo and #HandsOffZuma protesters have gathered outside Luthuli House where police have maintained a visible presence.

"The ANC respects and will always uphold the right of all citizens to protest, in a disciplined and peaceful manner, on any matter. We trust those who protest today will do so in a manner that does not undermine the genuineness or otherwise of their cause." Pro-Zuma supporters of the ruling party had warned they would storm the party headquarters if he was removed as state president, something many South Africans are clamouring for.
