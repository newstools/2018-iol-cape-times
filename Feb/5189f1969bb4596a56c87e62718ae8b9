Cape Town - President Cyril Ramaphosa's State of the Nation Address has been hailed as a success by many but the part that got Twitter talking was when he quoted "the late great Bra Hugh Masekela". Ramahosa said: "In his song, ‘Thuma Mina’, he anticipated a day of renewal, of new beginnings. He sang: 'I wanna be there when the people start to turn it around When they triumph over poverty I wanna be there when the people win the battle against AIDS I wanna lend a hand I wanna be there for the alcoholic I wanna be there for the drug addict I wanna be there for the victims of violence and abuse I wanna lend a hand Send me.” Ramaphosa added: "We are at a moment in the history of our nation when the people, through their determination, have started to turn the country around. We can envisage the triumph over poverty, we can see the end of the battle against AIDS. Now is the time to lend a hand. Now is the time for each of us to say ‘send me’." Here's what people on Twitter had to say:             A standing ovation for our new president, who ends his speech with quotes by Bra Hugh Masekela. This feels like a new beginning.
