Domestic airlines are allowing passengers travelling to Cape Town to carry the water as hand luggage, as their contribution to the city’s water crisis. FlySafair said it implemented the measure two weeks ago. “What we recognise is that our customers, like all South Africans, are desperate to try to help in whatever way they can. People want to carry their own water when travelling to the city and feel they are limiting the burden on the city’s resources and we respect that. "That said, we do want people to be informed about the environmental impact of carrying water by air, because transporting water this way is far more carbon intensive than transporting it by other means,” said Kirby Gordon, FlySafair sales and distribution head. Gordon said the rules were: five litres of water  per person over and above the 7kg hand luggage restriction. The water must be stowed beneath the seat in front of the passenger and the offer was not available to those seated in emergency exits or bulkhead rows. “We recommend purchasing square five-litre bottles which are easier to stow and less likely to roll around. Please preference sealed bottles as this will be preferred by airport security." In spreading the word, the crew had started making announcements in November last year, and the airline also included messaging into pre-flight e-mails to Cape Town-bound passengers. Luane Lavery, brand communication manager for BA and kulula.com, said they had the same water policy as FlySafair passengers heading to Cape Town. “Customers travelling to Cape Town are welcome to bring bottled water on board as part of their allocated baggage allowance, as long as the containers are within the permitted weight and size requirements for baggage, are properly sealed and can be stowed safely.”  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
