Their ages range from eight to 20 years. Announcing this yesterday, CapeNature director of marketing and ecotourism Sheraaz Ismail said: “It is heart-warming that through this race we can give children with disabilities the joy of adventure. Our giving does not only end with the cycle tour, but continues with several other facilities available on our nature reserves with wheelchair access.” The children and cyclists towing them are dubbed the Warrior on Wheels Teams. The youngsters comprise Damian James Gower, Ruan Belcher, Payton du Bois, Nura Mohamed, Jamie Litt, Tiaan Louw, Jacques Junior Booysens, Wiaan Botha and Luca Human. Those towing them will include teams of their parents and supporters, some of whom did previous tours, with and without the disabled children. Ismail said the Warrior On Wheels Foundation was this year partnering Cape Town Tourism in the cycle tour for the second time. She added that the new 
buggies were being sponsored by The Diamond Works Institute, CapeNature, Enterprise Solutions 365 and the Pedal Power Association. She said the Warrior On Wheels Foundation NPO aimed to promote universal access to tourism and sporting events, while giving the gift of adventure to some brave children who wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity of participating in an event of this nature. “CapeNature is honoured and proud to form part of this initiative. Providing universal access is at the core of what we promote,” Ismail said. She explained that the foundation relied on the generosity of sponsors for the manufacture of the buggies and costs of the children’s participation. These include entry fees, helmets, customised seating requirements, cycling jerseys, timing chips and costs related to the event. The cycle tour takes place on March 11.
