“I can’t determine what time those specific bloodstains were created,” he said. Joubert said the bloodstains were insignificant and could have been caused by a small cut, which he might not have felt. RELATED: Murder accused Jason #Rohde 'suffering from depression' “The bloodstains are very minor slight,” said Joubert. He agreed with the defence that in respect of Jason’s blood traces, it was not of such a nature to indicate trauma or violence. In his plea explanation, Jason said he and Susan had a fight over his infidelity. The night before the murder, Jason said in a scuffle he had hit his wife’s face. He recalled hitting her on the nose in a blocking movement and that Susan had blood on her right side after she had tripped on a pavement and landed on the edge of the garden bed. “The version presented is consistent to the bloodstains observed from looking at the crime scene. “Injuries sustained by the victim on her feet, two abrasions, were consistent with bloodstains halfway on the bed,” he said. Before the case adjourned State prosecutor, Louie Van Niekerk said he and the defence had made progress as to how the trial would continue. The case continues.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
