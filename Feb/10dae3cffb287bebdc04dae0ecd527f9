This emerged during the public consultations held by the board on Wednesday to give an opportunity for input on the classification guidelines review process. The public participation process comes after the controversial Xhosa film Inxeba (The Wound) received an X-rating. Inexa (The Wound) This effectively banned the film from cinemas and relegated it to adult exhibition facilities, with the FPB Appeals Tribunal restricting the age of viewers from 16 to 18. FPB acting chief operations officer Abongile Mashele said the FPB imposed the age restriction of 16 "because of the violence and the language used in the movie”. “When we went to the tribunal, it was rated 18X. The moment the (appeals) tribunal makes a decision, we have to implement it immediately, because by legislation they are an independent board and the decision of the tribunal becomes the decision of the board,” said Mashele. She said the appeals tribunal had not banned Inxeba and had not said it should not be shown, only limiting its screenings. Mashele said the tribunal was yet to give reasons why it restricted the movie. The classification guidelines are reviewed every five years to measure whether the current guidelines reflected South Africa’s societal values and norms. “The online space is something that some people are worried about. "Our online regulations will be passed. Our intention on online content is to empower you,” said Mashele. The public participation process aims to clarify: applicability of the current age restriction categories; expansion of the definition of blasphemy to consider whether matters of culture and religion should be a separate element; increasing the age restriction from parental guidance (PG) to 13 years, where impact of violence and sexual content is permissible; and adding gender-based violence as a consumer advisory. “We need to have a better- co-ordinated approach on how we classify films,” she said.
