The municipality, which includes Paarl, Wellington, Gouda, Saron and Simondium, did this on Wednesday in an effort to avoid a Day Zero disaster situation. So said Drakenstein executive mayor Conrad Poole, who added the most significant difference was that residents would be allowed a maximum of 50 litres per person per day. This, he said, was 37 litres less than under the current Level 6 restrictions. Poole explained that residential units consuming above 10 500 litres per month (based on 50 litres per person per day in a household of seven) would be prioritised for enforcement and water restrictors installed if consumers didn’t adhere to those measures. In addition, the first six kilolitres of water per month would no longer be provided for free to all households in Drakenstein, but charged at R4.66 per kilolitre. Only indigent households would still receive the free monthly six kilolitres, Poole said. “Drakenstein’s point of departure has always been that we should encourage our residents to save water while we still have water to save.” An overall record saving of 34%, when comparing last November's water consumption to that of November 2016, proves the success of this measure. “Unfortunately we have to increase the tariffs as a means to further motivate people to save more water, and it is in line with the Drakenstein Water Disaster Plan,” he said. Anyone contravening the new Level 6B restrictions and associated tariffs could be liable to a fine of up to R2 500 per contravention, or face imprisonment or both.
