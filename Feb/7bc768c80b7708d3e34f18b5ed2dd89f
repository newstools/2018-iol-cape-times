A woman was stabbed when a man attacked and robbed a family walking on Noordhoek beach, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said. NSRI Kommetjie medical crew responded at 8.08am to Klein Slangkop where a family - a man, his wife, and daughter - from Bellville, were at a security guard hut seeking assistance after being robbed of their possessions and the wife stabbed while walking on Noordhoek Beach, NSRI Kommetjie station commander Ian Klopper said. NSRI medics treated the woman for a head laceration, believed to have been sustained by a knife stabbing and Cape Medical Response (CMR), the SAPS, Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) rangers, Kommetjie Neighbourhood Watch and Fidelity Guards were activated, he said. "The patient was taken into the care of CMR paramedics and transported to hospital by a CMR ambulance in a stable condition and the dad and his daughter were not injured. "They had been taking a walk on the beach when they were assaulted by a man who robbed them of personal belongings. Police have opened an investigation," Klopper said. African News Agency/ANA
