Ramaphosa was delivering the keynote address at the launch of the centennial celebrations in honour of Nelson Mandela's birth. Ramaphosa stood on the same balcony Mandela did 28 years ago, the same spot where he held Mandela’s microphone while the late icon delivered his historic speech. Those in attendance at the Grand Parade yesterday included Mandela’s grandson Mandla and several ANC national executive committee members. Addressing the cheerful crowd, Ramaphosa admitted his party had a number of shortcomings. Some ANC supporters at the crowd chanted “Zuma must fall” while Ramaphosa was making his speech. Ramaphosa responded to them, saying: “We know you want this matter to be finalised. We know you want closure on this matter. We must keep our eyes on what is in the interests of all our people.” Unemployment, poverty, redistribution of land and the Cape Town water crisis were on the agenda, Ramaphosa said. “If there ever was a time when we should all be working together, this water crisis is the time when we should all join hands. "This drought that Cape Town is going through affects the poor people more than it affects the rich. It’s not the Western Cape alone going through the drought, a number of other areas are as well,” he said. “We must work together as Madiba taught us, to push back the frontiers of inequality. "It must be the year when we accelerate the return of the land to those it was taken from,” he said. “This must be a year we intensify efforts to unite the people of Africa. It must be a year where we lessen conflicts in Africa.” Speaking to the Cape Times shortly before Ramaphosa’s speech, Mandla Mandela said the celebrations were a very special occasion. “His release came when lot of South Africans gave a lot, and some paid with their blood,” he said.
