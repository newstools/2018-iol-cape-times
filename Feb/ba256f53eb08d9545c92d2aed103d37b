About 202 patients were evacuated when a fire started in the hospital on Saturday. The cause of the fire is being investigated. Spokesperson for the Klipfontein/Mitchells Plain sub-structure Monique Johnstone said clients requiring urgent health care are requested to access services at the Mitchells Plain Community Health Care Centre’s Emergency Centre in Eastridge until the Emergency Centre at the Mitchells Plain District Hospital is fully operational. “A temporary emergency centre has been set up at the Mitchells Plains District Hospital to attend to patients who are referred by the Mitchells Plain Community Health Centre emergency centre," said Johnstone.
