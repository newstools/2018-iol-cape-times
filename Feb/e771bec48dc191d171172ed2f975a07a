The regional weather forecast for Wednesday predicts partly cloudy and hot conditions in places over the interior. Showers are expected along the Overberg coast and afternoon thundershowers over the eastern parts, spreading to the south coast in the evening. The wind along the coast will be moderate easterly to south-easterly in the south but northwesterly in the west becoming fresh southerly to south-easterly in the afternoon. The expected UVB sunburn index has been classified as ‘extreme’. Combined level of dams supplying the city stand at 24.9%. While the City's progress on securing alternative water sources stands at 62%. In an effort to help reduce water usage to 50 litres per person per day and beat Day Zero, the City of Cape Town is rolling out further pressure testing across the metro.
Day Zero has moved to June 4, due to the continued decline in agricultural usage, and also as a result of Capetonians reducing their water usage in cooperation with the City of Cape Town’s efforts to bring down consumption. Cape Times
