Police spokesperson Sinathi Joni said an inquest case was under investigation by Tulbagh police after a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy died in the fire at Obiqua Singles, Tulbagh, just before midnight on Monday. Witzenberg municipality emergency services responded to a fire at Obiqua Street, Tulbagh, at about 11.50pm. Witzenberg municipal manager David Nasson said firefighters arrived on the scene with a 6000-litre capacity truck. “It took them 35 minutes to extinguish the fire and they spent another hour and 30 minutes on the scene before Tulbagh police took control of the scene. “Only one informal structure and two vehicles were destroyed. There were two fatalities,” said Nasson. He said that the mother of the children and two other children in her care had now been displaced. The fire took place days after four children were killed and one child sustained injuries in a fire that razed a backyard dwelling in Heuwelkroon,  Greyton, in the Overberg region at the weekend. They were having a sleepover and were sleeping when the fire engulfed the structure. Obiqua ward councillor Elizabeth Sidego said: “This area is an informal settlement and right now we don’t know what started the fire, but the mother has been admitted to hospital following the fire. “The other two children in her care were taken to family members while she receives treatment. “I will know more after visiting her at the hospital and then speaking to her family,” said Sidego.
