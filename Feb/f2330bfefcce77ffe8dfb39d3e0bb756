The parliamentary caucus of the governing ANC are set to proceed with a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma on Thursday, the party's treasurer-general, Paul Mashatile, said on Wednesday. "I have now reported to the caucus that the NEC (national executive committee) has decided to recall President Zuma and the deadline (for Zuma to resign) is today," Mashatile told journalists after addressing caucus in Parliament. "We have now asked the chief whip to proceed with the motion of no confidence tomorrow... so that President Zuma is then removed so that we can then proceed to elect President Ramaphosa." According to reports, the Economic Freedom Fighters' scheduled motion of no confidence would be amended by the ANC from the floor tomorrow. The caucus was initially meant to meet at 10am, but was pushed back to 11am after expectations that Zuma would address the nation, which never happened. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu announced that the ANC would remove Zuma from office tomorrow, and are likely to elect Cyril Ramaphosa president on the same day. The election of a new president "is premised on the availability of the Chief Justice", Mthembu said. "If we were to elect the new president tomorrow after the vote of no confidence, we would be firm that the State of the Nation address take place on Friday." African News Agency (ANA)
