I extend my apology not only for the victim I caused grievous harm to, but to her family, the African National Congress and South Africa at large. “My behaviour cannot and should not be justified. No amount of anger should lead one to acting in the manner that I did. "I take full responsibility for my actions, and as such, took the decision to hand myself over to the Johannesburg police station,” Setona said.

Matongo said the ANC condemns Setona's conduct and has suspended him pending a disciplinary inquiry. "His behaviour does not subscribe to the notion of the people violently assaulting those who hold contrasting political views." African News Agency/ANA
