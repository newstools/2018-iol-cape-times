The City says Day Zero, the day residents may have to start queueing for water, has now moved to 9 July. This is due to a weekly drop in dam levels of only 0.5% (as compared to a 1.9% drop in 2014). This week’s lower rate of consumption can be attributed to the Groenland water reaching Steenbras Upper Dam last week and slightly increasing the dam level, as well as to a further reduction in Cape Town’s weekly average demand to 523 megalitres per day (MLD) compared to 1 130 MLD in 2014. "Today I urge the residents of Cape Town not to ease up on their water-saving efforts. We cannot afford to slow down when the estimated Day Zero date moves out, simply because we cannot accurately predict the volume of rainfall still to come or when it will come. "Last year we had abnormally low winter rainfall, and we cannot assume that this year will be any different. "Our preparations for Day Zero continue as planned, along with the City’s aggressive roll-out of pressure management initiatives and the installation of water management devices at the properties of high users across the metro. "Enforcement blitzes will also continue to ensure that all water users adhere to the water restrictions," said the City's deputy mayor, Ian Neilson. Latest water dashboard (http://coct.co/water-dashboard/) · Day Zero: 9 July 2018 (was 4 June, 2018) ·  Dam levels: 24,4% (decline of 0,5%) ·  Total consumption: 523 million litres per day (73 million litres above the target of 450 million litres per day) ·   Percentage of Capetonians saving: *note, due to the implementation of 50-litre targets, this calculation is under review. Level 6B restrictions make it compulsory for residents to use no more than 50 litres per person per day. See the following link for the new tariff details: http://bit.ly/WaterTariff
