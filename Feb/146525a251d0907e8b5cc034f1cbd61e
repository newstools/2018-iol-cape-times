South Africans should be
patient with ANC leader
Cyril Ramaphosa as he holds talks with President Jacob Zuma for
a transition of power, the party's national chairperson said on
Saturday. Ramaphosa has been lobbying for Zuma to resign and has said
he hopes to conclude talks with him "in coming days ... in the
interests of the country". Addressing an ANC rally in Mpumalanga, Gwede Mantashe said ANC officials should be fearless
and must be able to make difficult decisions, but leaders had a
duty to "analyse and mitigate risks". "There is no disagreement about where we want to go (on
Zuma) but the tactics on how to do that is the responsibility of
leadership," Mantashe told the rally. Speaking to SABC television after his
speech, Mantashe said people should give the ANC space to manage
a "very complex situation". Read: #ZumaExit: ANCYL in Gauteng turns against JZ #Zuma may escape prosecution for #StateCapture "Allow (Ramaphosa) to lead, Leadership is a science, a
profession and also an art. Allow Cyril Ramaphosa to execute and
use his art and his personality to manage this," Mantashe said. Ramaphosa has ignored frustration from some sections of the
media and opposition parties who have been howling for Zuma to
go for years. Zuma, the most controversial president since the
end of apartheid, has overseen a tumultuous
nine years in power marked by economic decline and numerous
allegations of corruption. Zuma has not said whether he will resign voluntarily before
his second term as president ends in the middle of next year. He
still retains the support of a faction within the ANC but has
seen several prominent party allies desert him. Mantashe said ANC officials would meet later on Saturday to
discuss the transition, but Zuma will not be part of the
meeting. Ramaphosa is due to give a speech on Sunday as part of
year-long celebrations to mark 100 years since the birth of
former President Nelson Mandela. Reuters
