The Bishop Lavis resident was last seen in the neighbourhood on February 9. Page was a retired deacon at his local New Apostolic Church and lived alone in a two-bedroom house. His sister, Margaret Josephs, last spoke to him on Wednesday, February 7. It was the following Wednesday that a neighbour noticed Page had not attended church, and decided to inform the family. “We found the back door left open, which is not like my brother because he always keeps everything locked up. “The side where my brother slept on the bed was unmade. His slippers, gown, dentures and glasses were still in there,” Josephs said. She added that her brother had sustained 70% burns about two years ago, and hence wore a neck brace daily, but the brace was still there. “He only took it off at night. It is all a mystery because everything is intact, nothing appears to be stolen. The police said they did not suspect foul play.” Josephs said her brother was not sick, did not have dementia and it was not like him to just take off. “He was just at home, or went to church and hospital when he needed to,” she said, adding that nothing had seemed strange during their last conversation. “We were close, he would have told me if something was wrong. We looked at the Tygerberg Mortuary, and there was one unidentified person, but it was not my brother.” Josephs said they had opened a missing person case with the police. Any information that can help find Page can be forwarded to his niece, Arlene Josephs, at 072 657 5129.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
