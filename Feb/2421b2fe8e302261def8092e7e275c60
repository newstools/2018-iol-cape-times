Johannesburg - The DA has called for President Cyril Ramaphosa to fire Public Enterprises Minster Lynne Brown following the Public Protector's report which found that she lied to Parliament about a contractual relationship between Eskom and Trillian Capital. 
 
The party said it is now clear that Brown misled Parliament and she has contravened the executive ethics code and should be removed from cabinet. 
 
Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found in a report that allegations that Brown had lied to Parliament when she was asked about a contract between Eskom and Trillian, were substantiated.  
 
Trillian had been paid millions by Eskom. Read: Lynne Brown misled Parliament in Trillian-Eskom saga Mkhwebane said Ramaphosa should take action against the minister within 14 days for violating the executive ethics code and constitution. 
 
The DA said that if Ramaphosa is serious about leading a government that is not corrupt, he should prove it by firing Brown. 
 
"If the President is truly committed to building a government that is beyond reproach, he must immediately remove anyone who is found guilty of unethical behaviour from his Cabinet." Minister Brown has acted for far too long with utter impunity. It was under her watch that Eskom and our other parastatals were virtually financially ruined and ethically ruined. Her time has finally come to face the music," said the party. However, Brown has challenged the Public Protectors’ findings and has denied that she knowingly lied to Parliament.  
 
She has laid the blame on senior Eskom executives for misleading her. 
 
"When I became aware that senior Eskom officials deliberately mislead me. I immediately reported this to Parliament's ethics committee and the Public Protector," said Brown.  
 
"I also instructed Eskom board to take disciplinary action against those who conspired to mislead me, Parliament and the country," said Brown. IOL
