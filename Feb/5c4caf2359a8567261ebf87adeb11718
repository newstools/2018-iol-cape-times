The City has said technical challenges will result in more residents receiving estimated water accounts for January. Mayco member for Water, Xanthea Limberg, said the City moved from a third party electronic platform to an in-house electronic interface system for the uploading of monthly water meter readings, and since the move, there have been technical challenges with uploading meter readings to the new system. As a result, some customers will receive estimated bills although their meter was read. Customers across the City will be affected. "Where residents receive estimated bills, the City recommends that they settle the account as they would normally. If the estimate is higher than the actual usage then their account will be adjusted appropriately the next time the actual meter reading is captured. In cases where estimated consumption far exceeds actual consumption, and residents are unable to afford the bill, they can approach the City’s call centre or their closest walk-in centre to request an investigation. Debt management will be suspended until the investigation is resolved," Limberg said. Limberg said estimated bills are currently based on consumption for the same period in the previous year. For example, a meter estimate for January 2018 is based on the actual usage of January 2017. This method is used to account for seasonal variation in water consumption. The City is however working to adapt the estimation method to account for changing consumption patterns due to the current water shortage. From 1 March 2018, estimated accounts will be based on average consumption at the property for the previous three months. Residents can, however, avoid estimated bills altogether by submitting their own meter reading.
