Cape Town - Commuters, including schoolchildren, had to duck as bullets flew at the Langa taxi rank on Thursday morning, killing two people and injuring nine others. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the incident is believed to be related to taxi routes. "Nine people between the ages of 15 and 45 were injured and admitted to hospital for treatment. "The suspects responsible for the murders and attempted murders have fled the scene and are yet to be arrested. "Any person who can shed light on the whereabouts of the suspects is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111," Traut said. Provincial police management has established a taxi task team that will take over the investigation. In addition, police visibility has been enhanced at identified taxi hubs in the province, Traut said. A witness, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was at the taxi rank waiting to board a taxi when a group of about five men started firing shots randomly. "It seems as if these gunmen knew who they were looking for because they arrived and started shooting at their target. "There were children going to school. Information is that the shooting is because of taxi wars. Our safety is compromised," she said. Read: Two drivers shot dead, children injured in alleged taxi route dispute
