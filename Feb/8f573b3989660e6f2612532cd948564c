Ten-year-old Cody had at the time captured the hearts and imagination of many South Africans for surviving the veld fires, which had ravaged the Eden District and claimed at least 13 lives, as well as animal lives, and destroyed many informal and formal homes. Following the aftermath of those devastating fires, the stallion had been found about 100m from his home, with his face severely burnt and struggling with his vision. But with intensive treatment and a great deal of 
TLC, his recovery had been remarkable. Cody’s owner, Karen Rademeyer, explained that in 2014 her family bought the farm - along with a herd that included Cody - on which the horse was born. She said crowdfunding   had raised more than R100 000 towards a search at the time for ponies that had gone missing because of the fire, and for Cody’s treatment. “Cody’s injuries were facial and right up between his hind legs where they rub together. “He has to get special treatment on his feet as well, because it has formed trauma lines. We have to strengthen the hoofs so that they don’t crack,” Rademeyer said. “The first couple of vet bills were covered by the SA Veterinary Association (Sava), which was general funding that any vet could claim from. “Cody’s treatment by different vets had been ongoing. “Our biggest concern has been with his right eye. He can see. He’s had two corneal ulcers in both eyes, but his ulcer eyes have healed very nicely. “With intensive treatment and a great deal of TLC, his recovery has been remarkable and as far as we can tell his vision is fine, but the mask he wears interferes with his peripheral vision. It protects the area over both eyes, so that he can’t rub them.The fabric is 95% ultra-violet heat resistant. “His face will never be fully recovered. Mentally he has come on very well. ‘‘He is definitely over the trauma now. “I’m very happy with his progress. It’s been a long road to his recovery, and sometimes very frustrating, but he has made it.”  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
