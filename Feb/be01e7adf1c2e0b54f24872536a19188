Two men have been arrested in Cape Town for being in possession of drugs worth almost R9 million, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) in the Western Cape said on Saturday. The Hawks’ South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (Saneb), together with crime intelligence and the flying squad, acted on information received and intercepted a bakkie reportedly transporting drugs on Friday night, Captain Philani Nkwalase said. The bakkie was spotted and stopped on Owen Road in Elsie's River. Upon searching the vehicle, officers discovered 20 bags containing 1 000 Mandrax tablets worth more than R8.9 million were seized. Two suspects, 32 and 42 years old respectively, were arrested on charges of dealing and possession of drugs and would appear in the Goodwood Magistrate's Court on Monday, Nkwalase said. Earlier this month, an 18-year-old man was arrested after being found in the possession of 16 grams of dagga amounting to R2 400 in Lower Main Road, Woodstock. African News Agency/ANA
