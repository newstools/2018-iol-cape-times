George municipal manager Trevor Botha said the current municipal drought management policy did not specify the circumstances under which restrictions were lifted, nor did it address a crisis such as the one the rest of the province was experiencing. “The Garden Route dam may be 87% full today, but the realities of a larger crisis in neighbouring towns, the region and province cannot be ignored,” Botha said. George Municipality spokesperson Athane Scholtz said the crisis in the greater Western Cape and the need for long-term water security for George will be among the factors the George Municipality mayoral committee must consider before a decision regarding the possible lifting of water restrictions can be made. The drought disaster declaration requirements are applicable to the whole of the province irrespective of dam levels of individual municipalities in the province. “The George Municipality’s mandate is to ensure water security for its own people, which means a goal of water supply of at least a year. However, we are mindful that others may soon need our help to survive and saving water wherever we can may ultimately be about more than just supplying the current population of George. “The municipality chooses to be proactive in its water conservation efforts, with the hope that our water remains secure for our own people, but with the consciousness that the bigger picture may be outside our control,” Botha said. Level 2B restrictions remain in place, which prohibits, among others, the filling of swimming pools with municipal water and the washing of cars with a hose using municipal water. Water leaks and burst pipes can be reported to 044 801 9262 or after-hours at 044 801 6300. Report contraventions on 0800 424 277. Fines may apply.
