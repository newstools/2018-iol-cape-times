Cape Town - The Office of the ANC Chief Whip has slammed 'inaccurate' and 'misleading reports' that have surfaced about Thursday'sÂ ANC Parliamentary Caucus meeting. "Whilst the ANC does not usually comment on caucus discussions because they are confidential internal matters of the ANC; we want to distance ourselves from reports that ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa reportedly told caucus that President Zuma will resign on Saturday, and that he will not be granted immunity," said the party in a statement. The ruling party called these reports 'false' and stated that the reports were aimed to 'negatively disturb the fruitful and constructive engagement' between Ramaphosa and Zuma.
