Acting chief deputy commissioner Veliswa Mvandaba told delegates at a Department of Correctional Services (DCS) ex-offenders’ entrepreneurship summit expo, hosted in conjunction with ex-offender organisation Still Rise, that former offenders cannot be left alone, with communities and businesses shunning them. Wednesday's exhibition was part of DCS’s continued bid to improve reintegration of former offenders into society. DCS spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said the event was a summit of free civilians now trading as entrepreneurs. “The summit was attended by more than 30 former in-
mates. Their testimonies made reference to the skills they acquired in prison. "The summit included authors, welders, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics.” - African News Agency (ANA)
