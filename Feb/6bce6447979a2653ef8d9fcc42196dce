Cape Town - A cold front has been predicted to reach the country on Friday, spreading to the western interior and bringing much needed rain to the Cape. According to the South African Weather Service (SAWS), favourable rainfalls of 20 mm can be expected in mountainous areas of the Cape Metropole, Overberg and Cape Winelands, otherwise 5-10 mm has been predicted across the province. SAWS spokesperson Hannelee Doubell said the rain is due to an “unseasonal” cold front that will reach country on Friday. SAWS has also issued veld fire conditions warnings expected in places over the West Coast District, Cape Winelands, Central Karoo and Eden District on Thursday but only the Central Karoo Friday.
Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said the province has approved the allocation of an additional amount of R82.5 million to the Provincial Department of Local Government for drought augmentation projects in the province. This brings the total amount allocated by the Department on water augmentation projects since 1 April 2017 to R108.7 million. Bredell said the new additional funding approved will be focused on municipalities that border the City of Cape Town and which rely on the same water supply system as the city. “These municipalities are Saldanha Bay, Drakenstein and Swartland. The funds will go to relief measures including new water augmentation and demand management projects to avoid a situation where communities may run out of water. "We remain committed to assist the city in combating the ongoing drought crisis by reducing the pressure on the greater system,” Bredell said.
