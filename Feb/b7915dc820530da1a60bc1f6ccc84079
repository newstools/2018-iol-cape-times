Johannesburg - The EFF has postponed its urgent court application to force National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to allow for a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma to be held this week.
 
The party said it took the decision following engagements with the ANC caucus in Parliament.
 
The public would be advised when the engagements are concluded, the EFF said.
 
The ANC caucus is meeting in Parliament this morning to discuss developments about Zuma’s removal from office.
 
Mbete had agreed to the request from the EFF to hold a no confidence motion in Zuma, but set the date for February 22.
 
The EFF wrote to her to move the date to this week and had given her a deadline to respond on Tuesday.   Political Bureau
