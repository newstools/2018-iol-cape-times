The pupils were selected from about 100 athletes coached by kung fu champion Muhammad MJ Li Chafeker, who has brought home gold three times while representing South Africa at the International Legends of Kung Fu Championships in Dallas, Texas. However, if three of them cannot come up with the funds for the trip, they will bid the rest of their team farewell at the airport and miss the opportunity to represent their country at the tournament. Chafeker has urged businesses and individuals to come on board to give Clive Sinawo (captain) from Gugulethu, Angelo Njobe from Khayelitsha and Toufeeq Wyngaard from Bonteheuwel the opportunity to attend the 
tournament. Angelo and Clive are pupils at Windsor High School in Rondebosch East. Each athlete needs funds in the region of R26000. “Unfortunately, some of the athletes don't have the financial means to attend the tournament. But they are part of a team that I believe possesses the most potential that I have come across in the past year. “If they are not able to attend the tournament, it will be a travesty. These boys and girls have been training religiously for a year and now they are presented with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” said Chafeker. The tournament attracts about 9000 martial artists from 50 countries and Chafeker’s team will make history, being the first youth squad from South Africa to go to the championship.
