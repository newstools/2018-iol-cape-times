This year, the CTCT is expected to raise a charitable surplus in excess of R10m. The CTCT, one of the world’s largest individually timed cycle tours, raises the large amount of funds through entry fees and sponsorships. The funds are poured into community initiatives. The Rotary Club of Claremont said the Injongo Early Childhood Development project received more than R2m during the year. It is matched rand for rand by the Lewis Group to provide 
sustainable improvements at early learning centres in Philippi. Some of the CTCT funds were also channelled to other Rotary clubs to provide targeted support in their communities. The president of the Rotary Club of Claremont, Liz Rose, said: “We are committed to 
uplifting communities and have been intentional about supporting projects located in areas along the race route, where cyclists receive incredible support from residents on race day. “We partnered with Songezo Jim’s Cycling Academy in Masiphumelele last year, which received 15 new bicycles for aspiring young cyclists from the community. “We also provided financial support to the Muizenberg Community Safe House, which helps victims affected by domestic violence,” said Rose. She said other beneficiaries included the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, Groote Schuur Hospital and Mitchells Plain Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Marsh Memorial Homes and Ikamva Youth Development. “Every year Rotarians from all over the Western Cape volunteer, working incredibly hard behind the scenes to ensure the race goes well. “By organising this iconic race, we are able to channel significant amounts of money and energy into worthy projects that uplift communities, change lives and make a sustainable difference. “We hope that as cyclists cross the finish line on Sunday, March 11, they will not only celebrate their own personal sporting achievement, but also the effect that their entry has had in helping better the lives of others,” said Rose.  lonwabo.marele@inl.co.za
