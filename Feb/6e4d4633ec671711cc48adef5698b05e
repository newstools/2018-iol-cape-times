But thanks to a generous Cape Times reader, Faithlin Louw is able to pursue his goals. Louw, who matriculated from John Ramsay High School last year, started his tertiary education at the Robin Trust Nursing College. The Cape Times had reported about how Louw had to assume the role of being his family’s breadwinner after his mother died during his June exams. After reading the story, Izak Marais contacted the 19-year-old from Bishop Lavis to help. “My assistance is faith-based and I believe the best way to live the instruction to help your neighbour is if you can help by giving them an education. I believe if a person gets an education, they can help themselves and in turn then help other people.” Marais said after reading about Louw he knew the teenager had determination. Louw said he keeps in touch with Marais and was very grateful for his help. “I want to take the opportunity to thank the Lord for making my dreams come true. I want to thank Marais, the man who made it all possible by funding my studies, not just him but his wife as well. "If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be sitting where I’m sitting today,” Louw said.
