The Lesotho government has alerted its National Security Services to investigate allegations that fugitive Ajay Gupta is in that country, the SABC reported. Ajay Gupta is wanted by the Hawks in connection with corruption charges, which are not related to the Vrede dairy farm case, and there is reportedly a collective R1 million reward for information leading to the Gupta brothers' and Duduzane Zuma's arrest. Lesotho government secretary Moahloli Mphaka has assured South Africa of its full cooperation. “We have put that matter onto the national security services and the police to investigate that matter but I should reject that we have such person who has been housed in Lesotho. "And how it came out in the social media it says he was collected from the border by the VIP protection and is being housed in the state house. "There is no such thing, the Prime Minister of Lesotho and his government cannot do that to harbour people who are regarded to be criminals in South Africa,” the SABC reported. Forensic consultant Paul O'Sullivan's organisation, Forensics for Justice, offered a R100 000 reward "for any person that gives information that leads to the arrest of Ajay Gupta within the next 48 hours", which expires at 6pm on Saturday. O’Sullivan offered an additional R100 000 reward leading to the arrest of Ajay’s brothers Atul and Rajesh, also known as Tony, as well as Duduzane Zuma, with an additional R100 000 bonus if all four were arrested. Sygnia Group CEO Magda Wierzycka tweeted she was "willing to match the reward rand for rand" for Ajay Gupta. So now we have R1 million in the pool”. On Friday morning, Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said he believed Ajay Gupta was still in the country and they also know the security company protecting him. Muladuzi also revealed that another director of a Gupta company is facing imminent arrest.
