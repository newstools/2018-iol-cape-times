Planned pressure management work, scheduled for today, was set to from 8pm to 4am in Green Point, Sea Point, the V&A Waterfront and the 
areas bounded by Beach Road to the north and including Seacliff Road to the west, Coen Steytler Road (Dock Road) to the east and High Level and Buitengracht roads to the 
south. Xanthea Limberg, Mayco member for informal settlements, water and waste services, said: “Not only does pressure management generally lower consumption by reducing the rate at which water flows to properties, it also reduces the risk of leaks and pipe bursts by better ensuring that pressure remains within levels that the pipework can tolerate, and reduces the rate of loss from leaks and bursts. "We are doing absolutely everything in our power to avoid Day Zero. We must lower consumption otherwise we will reach Day Zero. “We have identified 25 areas across the city that could 
benefit from this technology over the next three months, 
and contractors have been brought in to speed up the 
programme.” Careful consideration has been given to ensure minimal disruption to the water supply in the affected areas, and roll-outs to other parts of the metro will be communicated in due course. Residents are requested to keep all taps closed and store five to 10 litres of water for essential purposes during this time. They are asked not to store an excessive amount of municipal water. Level 6B water restrictions are in effect as of today and residents are requested to 
use 50 litres a person per 
day. The City’s website indicated that the current overall 
dam levels for the province were at 26%, as the last 10% of a dam’s water was difficult to remove, the useable water in the dam was approximately 10% less than the dam level.
