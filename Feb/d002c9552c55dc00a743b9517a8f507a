Cape Town - President Jacob Zuma is set to face another motion of no confidence in his leadership. National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete said the debate of the motion will take place on February 22. The debate was requested by the EFF earlier this week, but the party had asked for a special sitting of the National Assembly to called to debate the motion before the State of Nation Address (SONA).
 
The EFF’s deputy president Floyd Shivambu said the party was not pleased with date set as it was useless to allow Zuma to address the nation while his leadership will still be debated.
 
“It is useless to want to have a debate after SONA. Why have a state of the national address on the 8th and then debate the motion on the 22? What they have decided now is not logical and we will engage Parliament on this,” said Shibamvu.
 
“Zuma will be removed through a no confidence vote called by the EFF.”
 
The DA had also written to Mbete and requested that SONA be postponed, but Mbete has refused.
 
“In her letter replying to the DA leader Mr Mmusi Maimane’s request that the State of the Nation Address be postponed, Ms Mbete explained that the President, as head of State and Government, had exercised powers vested in him in terms of the Constitution (section 84(2)(d), read together with Joint Rule 7(1), when he called on Parliament to convene the State of the Nation Address. The Joint Programme Committee had also further ratified the convening of the Address, at its meeting on 16 November 2017. The Speaker, therefore, had no power to accede to the DA’s request to postpone the State of the Nation Address, scheduled for delivery to a joint sitting of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces on 8 February,” said the Speakers office on Friday afternoon.
