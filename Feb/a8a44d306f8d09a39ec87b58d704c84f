The Central Line was suspended for more than a month following the killing of a security guard at Chris Hani train station in Khayelitsha in 
January, which forced thousands of commuters to find alternative transport. The line also had to be suspended several times because of incessant and sustained attacks on rail infrastructure from 2015 after protesting residents targeted the trains. On Sunday, a security guard escorting train drivers had a narrow escape after being attacked and shot at by assailants in Samora Machel. Yesterday, acting Prasa group executive Cromet Molepo conducted an inspection and interacted with commuters on the Central Line. “At this stage we are unable to confirm a date for resumption of a full service,” said Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott. The extra security measures would be in place day and night to enable technical teams to repair vital equipment and prevent further attacks on rail infrastructure. “Asset protection and target-hardening measures continue to ensure that vital infrastructure such as point machines, apparatus cases and track boxes are secured,” said Scott. No decision was taken on whether to expand the interventions to other lines affected by crime, she said. The United National Transport Union has charged that Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker’s “mismanagement” of services in the province was the reason for the Central Line being suspended for more than five weeks.
