He delivered a keynote address at a public debate at the University of the Western Cape yesterday. In his address, he outlined the controversy surrounding the status of land rights as they affect post-apartheid South Africa. He also discussed the ANC’s recent resolution on expropriation of land without compensation, and his own work as advocate and acting judge in the Land Claims Court. His address came as the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform stated in its report that only 4% of black South Africans owned private land compared to their white counterparts, who owned 72%. Ngcukaitobi said since the ANC governed “there was no meaningful change to the land distribution pattern”. He said section 25 of the constitution “enables the state to pass a law that would mandate restitution of land but only in respect of those who can prove claims relating to the dispossession of land in 1913”. However, Ngcukaitobi said corruption and bureaucracy had “inhibited” land reform.
