One of the Two Oceans Aquarium's most famous and beloved former inhabitants, Yoshi the loggerhead turtle, was released about a month ago, 27 nautical miles off Hout Bay. Along with the 183kg Yoshi, 27 rehabilitated hatchling loggerhead turtles were released. She was fitted with a satellite tag as researchers hope to track her journey for up to three years. Given that female sea turtles always return to the beaches where they hatched to lay their own eggs, the aquarium has been tracking Yoshi’s journey closely as she makes her way back home. Yoshi was the size of a dinner plate when she arrived at the aquarium in 1996. She was handed over by a chef on board a fishing vessel in Table Bay harbour and was named after the chef, Yoshi. Currently she is about 71km north west of the Orange River and about 15km offshore in very nice 19°C water with a depth of about 113m. At a point, she travelled about 30km over the space of 24 hours, indicating that Yoshi is looking strong. Her average distance per day has reduced slightly to 27km, mainly due to a few days hanging out closer inshore, most likely feeding. She has covered a total distance of 1 233km over the last 43 days, moving through areas with commercial fisheries. She has already navigated past various tuna and hake long-line areas. Her swimming speed is 1.19km per hour, which is well within the normal range for wild, as well as released loggerhead turtles. The team has registered 276 satellite passes, each counted when she emerges from the water. She is now 731km at a 341° heading (north-northwest) from her release site, that is the straight-line distance. - Staff Writer
