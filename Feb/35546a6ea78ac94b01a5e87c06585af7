Critics claim the move could leave three communities from informal settlements homeless. The Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) received approval from the Department of Environmental Affairs last week for the realignment of a 3500m runway. Those in favour of the project say the realignment will boost the city and the province’s economy by 
R3.8billion. The Symphony Way Temporary Relocation Area, otherwise known as Blikkiesdorp, was established 10 years ago for people awaiting low-cost housing. Each structure houses between five and 15 people. Blikkiesdorp joint committee member Jane Roberts said the residents of Freedom Farm, Blikkiesdorp and Malawi Camp met yesterday about the realignment process. “We came to the decision that we would accept the decision of the City, as long as it doesn’t disadvantage any of our communities. “Since the announcement, we have not heard any concrete plans or how the City plans to relocate people or the timelines,” she said. Mayco member for transport and urban development Brett Herron said: “We are working in collaboration with Acsa, but the two sites must be developed in an integrated and connected way.”
