Johannesburg - The National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams is set to soon make an announcement on the corruption case against former president Jacob Zuma. 
 
Abrahams has written to the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) asking the organisation to waive the two-week notice period that he had committed to as he is ready to make a decision. 
 
The NDPP had received recommendations last week from a group of prosecutors assigned to analyse whether Zuma should face corruption charges.
 
He had promised Casac that he would give the organisation a two week notice before he makes the announcement
 
Now it is up to Casac to respond to the notice and advise Abrahams of its decision. 
 
If the organisation agrees, Abrahams could soon make an announcement on whether or not Zuma will face corruption charges. 
 
The charges relate to the spy tapes matter, and if they are reinstated he could face 18 charges for over 700 counts of corruption, money laundering, fraud and racketeering. In October last year, the Supreme Court of Appeal confirmed an earlier judgment issued by the High Court in Pretoria, that the decision to drop corruption charges against Zuma was irrational. The case was dropped in 2009 just months before Zuma would be sworn in as president. On Sunday the City Press Newspaper reported that the group of prosecutors had recommend to Abrahams that Zuma should be charged. Political Bureau
