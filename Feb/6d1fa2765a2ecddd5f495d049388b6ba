Deputy mayor Ian Neilson said the City had introduced innovative engineering initiatives, including advance pressure reduction at bulk water reservoirs and reticulation, in an effort to drive down water demand. “The City is making an enormous effort to delay Day Zero. It has installed thousands of water management devices on the properties of high users to ensure that we better our record low overall water-loss percentage of 16% (compared to the national average of 36%),”  Neilson said. He pointed out that the City’s average first response time to reported leaks and bursts was under two hours. “We have over the past months escalated our campaign to restrict excessive users,” Neilson said. Mayco member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy, Xanthea Limberg, said the City had received some complaints about faulty devices, but this number represented a small percentage of the total number of devices installed to date. “The devices meet the required specifications as set out in the South African National Standards (SANS) 1529-1 and SANS 1529-9. The approval of devices is done on submission of samples to the SABS. “The City does correspond with the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications as and when required, and can confirm that the devices still meet the required specifications,” Limberg said.
