Cape Town - Speaker Baleka Mbete has confirmed the new president will be sworn in on Thursday at 2pm after the resignation of former president Jacob Zuma. It is expected that ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa will be sworn in as the head of state. The ANC has a majority of 62 percent in the House, and the opposition is expected to field its own candidate to contest the nomination. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu told the programming committee that they had moved the swearing in from Friday at 10am to Thursday after Zuma’s resignation. He also said Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng will be available to swear in the new president.
