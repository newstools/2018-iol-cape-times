They said their protest follows persistent efforts from early last year by their landlord - the social housing NGO Sohco Property Investments company - to evict 32 tenants from its low-cost housing Steen Villa complex in Steenberg. The eviction attempts had been characterised by tenants blockading nearby Military Road with burning tyres last August, Sohco bringing eviction court cases against the tenants, and the temporary removal of some tenants from their flats by the Red Ants acting for the sheriff of the court and Sohco. Yesterday’s demonstration by 100 people consisted of mainly woman tenants, with a few babies in arms and prams, displaying placards. “We have come here on a hunger picket. We ain’t going to move. We ain’t going to
eat. If they want to arrest us, they must arrest us with our children, and take us and go. “(We’ll picket) until President Cyril Ramaphosa comes out here and listens to our story, because we refuse to be thrown out of our homes like dogs. "We’re no one’s animals, we’re human beings. Why should we be thrown out like dogs?” Sohco chief executive Heather Maxwell said Sohco was unaware of the event, and had no comment beyond stating that evictions were court-ordered and implemented by the sheriff of the court. According to Sohco, the NGO is committed to the development and management of social housing in
the Buffalo City, Cape Town and Durban metropolitan areas. Its primary purpose is the development of quality, affordable residential property for low-income households and in particular formerly disadvantaged members of the community who qualify for the government housing subsidy.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
