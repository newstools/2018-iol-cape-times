While the pharmaceutical industry continues efforts to create cell-based products, MD Stem Cells believe that harnessing the body's own repair mechanisms can produce important benefits. MD Stem Cells are a group of doctors who study and access information to advance stem cell treatments. They are currently working on a trial study that could lead to the cure of RP. RP is a rare, inherited degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision 
impairment. According to Levy, they are seeing “very promising results from the trial”. “The original study, the stem cell ophthalmology treatment study, or Scots, was started in 2013 and now we are on to the second study, called the stem cell ophthalmology treatment study II, or Scots 2. We have in total treated about 500 patients. We use bone marrow-derived stem cells. "We are the only stem cell study for the eyes (retina and optic nerve) that has published results.” Levy said the study was doing very well, with positive, significant data emerging. “Please be aware this is a patient-funded study and costs $19 600 (R227 833). It is done in Florida at a licensed surgical centre.”  lonwabo.marele@inl.co.za
