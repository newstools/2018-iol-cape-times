Working on Fire (WoF) assistant project manager Makelepe Maseko, 36, died on Monday in the blaze which started at the weekend. His death follows that of 33-year-old Candice Kruger, who died battling a blaze on the slopes of Table Mountain last week. The latest  fire started on Saturday on a forestry company's property and moved into the Simonsberg Mountains. WoF had 25 firefighters working on containing the blaze, and it was declared contained on Sunday evening. The fire flared up on Monday due to unfavourable weather conditions. WoF managing director Trevor Abrahams said counselling had been given to Seokoma’s family. WoF will also provide support to his family with all the funeral and memorial arrangements. “Originally from Limpopo, he leaves behind his wife and children. He started at the Working on Fire Sekororo Base in Limpopo as a firefighter in 2004 and moved up the ranks in the programme from crew leader to instructor and to the position of assistant project manager, which he held until his untimely death. "He will always be remembered by his fellow team members and the fraternity of WoF for his good sense of humour and dedication to his work. “We wish to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt condolences to the Seokoma family for the loss of their loved one,” Abrahams said.
