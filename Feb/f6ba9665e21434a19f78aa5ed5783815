This warning follows complaints from residents that their tap water was brown. The municipality said muddiness in the water was due to a high quantity of organic matter and impurity that was washed into the dams during last week’s rains in the catchment area. “This turbidity causes the chlorination of the water to be ineffective. "As a result too little chlorine is present in the water, and therefore the quality of the water cannot be guaranteed. "In light of this, residents are advised to boil the water before human consumption until further notice,” said municipality spokesperson Ntobeko Mangqwengqwe. Last Wednesday there was heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the Raubenheimer Dam, Melville Dam and Rust and Vrede waterfall, with 40mm and 50mm of rain recorded at the sites respectively. “Masses of water flowed into the two dams due to the rain,” Mangqwengqwe said. “The vegetation in the 
catchment area has not been sufficiently restored after the fires of December 2016 to reduce the flow rate against the mountain slopes, and so the water flowing into the dams is very turbid. The turbidity reduces the effectiveness of chlorination.” Water samples have been taken in the reservoirs and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Last week, Oudtshoorn residents were urged to boil their water after the municipality recorded high levels of bacteria in it. The municipality said the results of their water samples released on Monday morning showed that the bacteriological counts were high. It was suspected that there might have been a mouse or dove in the reservoir in question, causing the problem, or that there was an error in the sampling reading. The water was later declared safe for human consumption.
