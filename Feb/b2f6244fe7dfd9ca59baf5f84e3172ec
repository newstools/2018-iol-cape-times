Mariam Snyman, 2, Kenwin Latier, 9, Joshua Jaers, 10, and Breyton Wildschutt, 13, died, while Ashley Latier, eight, was admitted to hospital 
with burns. “Ashley escaped through a window, but the other children were caught inside by the fire. "It’s still so unreal for us and we have been helped by our neighbours and the officials, but it still hurts to even think of how they died,” she said. Department of Social Development spokesperson Sihle Ngobese said counselling was provided to the parents and children at the school, as well as to traumatised residents. He said the department’s Theewaterskloof local office would ensure ongoing services would be provided. Meanwhile, the mother who lost two of her children in a fire in Tulbagh on Monday, Lindiwa Hinana, has returned to her family. A fire broke out in an informal settlement in Obiqua Street, Tulbagh, and spread to the structure that Hinana occupied with her three children and grandchild. Ward councillor Elizabeth Sibego said: “Lindiwa’s mother told me she has been given medication to deal with the trauma. "She was not handling it well as she lost her husband in a car crash last year. “She was working night-shift and her teenage daughter was not at home at the time the fire started near a few cars, and spread because there were strong winds that night.” Cape Times
