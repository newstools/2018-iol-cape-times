Beach-goers and tourists couldn't contain their curiosity on Saturday when they saw 20 women flaunting their voluptuous figures in celebration of body positivity. The group was brought together by Thick Girl Supremacy (TGS), a plus-size model agency based in Johannesburg, founded by Boitshoko Gasebone. “I started TSG during 2016 and the agency is all about body positivity and celebrating plus-sized women. We are based in Johannesburg but have now branched out to Cape Town. “The models in the launch shoot were the successful candidates from a pool of 200 applicants in Cape Town. We were really so happy to see just how well the concept was received by the models and also by the public. People stopped along the way to ask what we were doing this for and they just sat in awe witnessing this group of girls having a great time,” Gasebone said. She added that meeting the models at the Cape Town photo shoot was an "overwhelming experience and the women who were part of it all, did it for their own reasons. It really was an amazing experience”. One of the models who participated, 29-year-old Melissa Smith from Mitchells Plain, said she wanted to be a part of the photo shoot to celebrate motherhood. “I thought long and hard about this and why I wanted to be a part of it. I have always been chubby and people would always say ‘you’re pretty for a big girl’ and I wanted to steer away from that,” Smith said.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
