The Chamber of Mines wants to meet Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, recently elected to lead the ruling ANC party, to try to break an impasse over a charter unveiled last year which mining companies believe will hurt the sector, a senior official said on Tuesday. The industry has clashed with Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane, accusing him of negotiating in bad faith after he unveiled the charter last year, slammed by critics as poorly drafted and hard to implement. "We have written to him, we have indicated that as soon as his diary permits, that we want to start engaging with him," the president of the Chamber of Mines Mxolisi Mgojo told a news conference on the sidelines of an annual conference dubbed the "mining indaba".
