Johannesburg - The Department of Justice and Correctional Services will release the regulations that will govern the state capture inquiry on Friday afternoon. Their regulations will enable the inquiry to begin its work. Itâ€™s been weeks since President Jacob Zuma announced the establishment of the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture. The inquiry will be headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. The department had already released the terms of reference for the inquiry which are in line with the former Public Protector Thuli Mandonsela's state of capture report. The report had implicated a number of government of officials in corrupt activities involving the infamous Gupta family and Zuma. But the inquiry's scope has been criticised as the terms of reference can be changed while the commission is underway. It will also have to probe corrupt activities in all government departments and not just those departments implicated in the state of capture report. The department said the regulations would be in line with the state of capture report. Zondo will now be able to subpoena witnesses and collect evidence. "The regulations provides the legal machinery that enables the Deputy Chief Justice to obtain resources and infrastructure he requires for the commission to perform its functions," said the department in a statement on Friday.
