Metrorail has confirmed that trains will resume operating on the Central Line from Wednesday, nearly a month after it suspended services following vandalism and an attack on a security guard in Khayelitsha. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said: “Trains will operate from 5am to 8pm on an hourly frequency, with two exceptions each on the Chris Hani and Kapteinsklip routes.” Metrorail Regional manager Richard Walker said: ‘The suspension of the Central service confirmed that Cape Town cannot function effectively without rail. ‘While our customers were extremely frustrated by the suspension of their service, they also understood the importance of ensuring that when trains start to operate again, they would be safe for use” Walker confirmed that 88 additional armed security guards and two armoured vehicles had been deployed to patrol day and night, to enable technical teams to repair vital equipment and prevent further attacks on rail infrastructure. He said asset protection and measures to ensure that vital infrastructure, such as point machines, apparatus cases and track boxes were secured, were instituted. Commuters were requested not to travel on top, in front of or at the back of a train, to ensure that doors remain closed in transit, and to not jump into/out of moving trains.
