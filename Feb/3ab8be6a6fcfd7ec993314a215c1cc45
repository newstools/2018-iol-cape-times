Cape Town - Vital Health Foods has issued an immediate product recall on its Mini Corn Cakes and Mini Rice Cakes. In a statement, Vital Health Foods issued the recall as a precautionary measure following an investigation into two consumer complaints regarding metal fragments found within the products. Vital Health Foods said the fragments appear to have been caused by an equipment malfunction during the manufacturing process. The fragments may not be visible as they are baked inside the Mini Corn Cakes and Mini Rice Cakes. Vital Health Foods chief executive Justin Williamson said between July 1, 2017 and January 31, 2018 the company we produced over 1.2 million units of the affected products. “Only two incidents have been reported and our assessment indicates that the problem is isolated to less than 0.0002% of the stock produced. "However, we take customer safety very seriously and invite all consumers who purchased Vital Mini Corn Cakes or Mini Rice Cakes in any pack size or flavour with a best before (BB) date between 1 February, 2018 (01/02/18) and 31 August, 2018 (31/08/18) to either discard the product, or return it to the retailer from where it was bought for a full cash refund,” he said. No other products are affected in any way Williamson added. 
 
Vital Health Foods said all of its products undergo and adhere to strict quality controls. Its facilities conform to manufacturing best practice as prescribed by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), a global standard for food safety.
