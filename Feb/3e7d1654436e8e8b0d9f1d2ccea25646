Former Gupta-owned media company TNA appears to have run into trouble, with employees complaining on Monday that they have not been paid. Journalists at television station ANN7 and The New Age newspaper said they were supposed to be paid on Monday, but their bosses said there was a technical problem that caused the delay. In August last year, the Guptas sold the media house to Mzwanele Manyi, who could not be reached for comment. Reports at the time said Gupta-owned Oakbay sold ANN7 and The New Age through a vendor financing agreement to Manyi-owned firm Lodidox. This suggested the Guptas loaned Manyi the money to buy their media entities. The Gupta brothers - Ajay, Atul and Rajesh - are out of the country. Local law enforcement agencies say they have a warrant of arrest for Ajay Gupta, who is accused of corruption in an unspecified matter. A bank account belonging to Atul Gupta has had at least R10 million frozen on suspicion that the money was proceeds of a crime linked to the alleged siphoning of funds meant for empowering poor farmers at a Vrede dairy in the Free State. All banks in SA are no longer willing to do any business with the Guptas, except for the bank of Baroda which has announced that it will soon cease operations in in the country. In Johannesburg, TNA staff were told on Monday that a technical glitch caused by a switch of banks had caused the salary delay. Messages left with TNA spokesman Gary Naidoo went unanswered. So far three Gupta owned mines - Shiva Uranium, Optimum and Koornfontein - have all failed to pay their workers salaries for February. TNA journalists said the situation was causing them a lot of stress and they were considering downing tools. African News Agency (ANA)
