National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams was on Friday scheduled to receive recommendations from his prosecution team on whether former president Jacob Zuma will be charged for corruption. Last week, the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Abrahams said he had given the team dealing with corruption allegations against Zuma until Friday to make recommendations on the matter. "The NPA [National Prosecuting Authority] confirms that the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Advocate Shaun Abrahams, has directed the prosecution team to provide him with their recommendations by no later than Friday, 23 February, 2018," a short statement from the NPA said. "Upon receipt thereof, the National Director will advise on the way forward, including the date by which he would advise of his decision." Zuma filed papers with the NPA on January 31 in which he gave reasons why he should not face fraud and corruption charges. The NPA had set an initial deadline of November 30 last year, but Zuma asked and was granted a seven-week extension. On November 30, South Africa’s biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), filed papers with the NPA outlining why 783 counts of corruption, fraud, money laundering, and racketeering against Zuma, should immediately be instituted. The Supreme Court of Appeal last year refused the NPA and Zuma leave to appeal a high court ruling which set aside the 2009 decision to drop the charges - related to South Africa's arms deal. Zuma, 75, resigned as President of South Africa on February 14, under severe pressure from his party the ruling African National Congress, bringing an end to his nine scandal-riddled years at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The NPA is also expected to give updates on the Vrede dairy corruption matter in which the Gupta brothers Ajay and Atul are reportedly suspects. African News Agency/ANA
