Gigaba said on Thursday, the Budget was pro-poor and not against the poor. He would not be a populist, he added, and the decisions taken were in line with the needs of the country. The ANC’s alliance partners, the SACP and Cosatu, opposition parties and civil society slammed the Budget and an increase in VAT, saying it would harm the poor. Briefing the joint committees on finance, Gigaba said the country's debt, which was approaching 60% of the gross domestic product, would have been R2.5 trillion in the next three years. The debt had increased from 38 percent of the GDP in 2012 to over 50% this year, he said, and it had not been stabilised. He said spending the money now and paying a huge debt later was anti-poor. This would risk being downgraded, he said. “ Any downgrade by Moody’s now will affect the poor most severely. The only other place we could borrow. because the financial institutions would have refused. is the IMF and believe you me that is not pro-poor,” he said. President Cyril Ramaphosa also warned last November that South Africa could not afford to go to the IMF because of its tough conditions. Ramaphosa said the IMF would have stripped the country of its sovereignty. Gigaba said they were not prepared to be populists and present a Budget that did not address the needs of the country. "The choices we have made may not be best, but under the conditions we face they are the best,” he said. The government has cushioned the poor in the Budget by providing free education for families with a combined income of R350 000 a year, he said. “The Budget must not be viewed on its individual items, but in its totality,” said Gigaba.
