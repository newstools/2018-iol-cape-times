Goosain Abrahams, 69, said he was told trolleys were not allowed at collection points, and this confused him. “I was stopped and told that I am not allowed to use a trolley to carry the water, but it's so heavy. Fortunately, a stranger was kind enough to help me,” Abrahams said. The City’s executive director for safety and security, Richard Bosman, said officials were engaging with national and provincial government, as well as businesses, communities and NGOs, to make special provisions for people who were physically unable to collectwater from 
a collection point. Abrahams says he is happy to hear things have changed. Residents will now be allowed to use trolleys when collecting water at the spring. “We are very aware that special provisions need to be made to ensure all people are able to access water, particularly those who are physically unable to collect it from a water collection point and what role they will need to play in ensuring that all persons are able to access their 25 litres of water per day,” Bosman said. The City said it would implement new rules for the Newlands Spring, with new routes, next month owing to congestion.
