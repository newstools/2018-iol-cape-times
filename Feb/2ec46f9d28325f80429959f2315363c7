SANParks rangers and police are on high alert following the mugging of a Dutch couple in the Wilderness on Monday. "We received the news with shock at about 14:30 yesterday and immediately responded by increasing the number of rangers patrolling the Brown Hooded trail," Garden Route National Park manager Paddy Gordon said. The couple was robbed of their valuables. "Upon hearing news of the robbery, SANParks rangers and SAPS immediately went to look for suspects as described by the victims. "The couple is expected to attend a trauma debriefing session organised by the Police. While SAPS continues to search for the suspects, SANParks has escalated the number of patrols on the trail and continues to engage the Policing Forum for Wilderness," SANParks said. All visitors have been requested to hide their valuables while on trails. This includes jewellery, cameras, cellphones and others. The Brown-hooded trail is a three- hour linear route which is about 5km. It goes through forest patches and hikers get to cross the Duiwe River at least five times.
