Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlope issued a warrant of arrest after Rohde had failed to turn up for the second day in a row. One of his attorneys, Daniel Witz of WCIS Attorneys, confirmed on Tuesday that their client was arrested “and is being held at the police station in Stellenbosch.

The judge also wants to hold an inquiry into his mental state,” Witz said On Monday, the court also sent the investigating officer to fetch Rohde at the hospital in Cape Town. Advocate Pete Mihalik asked for a seven-day postponement so that his client could recover from his illness, which he did not disclose. No medical certificate was submitted to the court. In 2016, Rohde was arrested for his wife’s murder and is out on bail of R1.1million. Issues regarding his bail are also to be discussed in court on Wednesday. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said Rohde was detained after the judge issued a warrant for his arrest early yesterday. The Western Cape National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila confirmed that a warrant of arrest was issued yesterday. “The police are supposed to enforce it,” he said. Rohde was arrested in July, 2016 after his wife Susan was found dead in a bathroom at the Spier Wine Estate in Stellenbosch. At first it was suspected that the 47-year-old schoolteacher had committed suicide. A post-mortem later showed that she was strangled. A medical report indicated that she was smothered, her lung injured and three of her ribs broken.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
