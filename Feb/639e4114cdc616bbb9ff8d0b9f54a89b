Her eldest child, Ebrahim Ongori, 23, said they had seen her prepare for work on January 23, but she did not arrive at work and has been missing ever since. “My mother has never done this type of thing. She only goes to work and spends time with us,” Ongori said. The police have confirmed the disappearance is under investigation. Manyara, a Kenyan national, owned a hair salon in Kraaifontein for 10 years, generally leaving home for work around 9.30am each day. The single mom rented a room in a house in Plein Street, Parow, with her three children. On the day she went missing, her two teenage children left the house to go to school, while her oldest son went to work and Manyara was still preparing to go to work. “Around 7pm, a lady who works with my mom came home without my mom and said she had been trying to reach my mom all day. “We immediately knew something was not right because she always comes straight home after work.” Ongori said they had searched for her, but no trace of his mother has been found. He added that his mother was single and did not have many friends. “We are with family now, but it is not easy, we just have to stay strong. “Our biggest hope is that my mom is still alive and that we will find her. We miss her very much, she did everything for us. She played the role of a mother and father. Anybody with any information must please contact me.” Ongori can be contacted on 073 374 2389.
