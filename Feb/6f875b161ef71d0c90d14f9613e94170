The repair work meant the City had to shut off the 1.2m diameter water main which feeds the reticulation network for a large area stretching from Philippi, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Ottery, Retreat and Pelican Park up to Wynberg, Plumstead and Southfield. Mayco member for water Xanthea Limberg said: “In order to repair the valve it was necessary to empty the pipeline.” The City could not confirm how much water was lost. “The bulk main has now been fully recharged and refilling of the smaller 
distribution systems has commenced. This process will need to be done very slowly to prevent undue stress on the infrastructure. "However, we can confirm that access to water for surrounding residents is slowly being restored. “The leak occurred at a valve that is used to drain the pipeline for maintenance purposes. The connecting bolts at the joint with the main pipeline were badly corroded and could not withstand the water pressure,” Limberg said. Water and sanitation management department spokesperson Farouk Robertson said before the repairs were completed, the water supply was rerouted via the Wynberg bulk water mains as far as possible. “Our repair teams worked throughout (Monday night) and earlier (yesterday) morning managed to remove the leaking valve for maintenance. “A new valve (was inserted yesterday morning) and the bulk water main will be recharged. “This is a slow process due to the immense water pressure in the pipeline. “Once filled, the valves to the remainder of the reticulation network will be opened and the water supply to the affected areas will be normalised,” Robertson said.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
