Cape Town - DA leader Mmusi Maimane has called for new elections following election of Cyril Ramaphosa as state president. Maimane said: "This is the ANC you (Ramaphosa) have inherited. This is the ANC you have been part of for years. And this is our country’s biggest problem. "That is why we have moved a motion in terms of Section 50 of the Constitution, to dissolve parliament and call an early election”. He congratulated Cyril Ramaphosa on his election but proceeded to call for new elections “to allow South Africans to give a new mandate”. He said South Africans must be able to punish the ANC for what it has done for 10 years. “South Africa’s Jacob Zuma problem is gone, but its ANC problem is still very much here. That is why we need a new election as soon as possible,” added Maimane. DA is joined by the EFF in their call to have Parliament dissolve, and new elections to take place. Ramaphosa will be the fifth president of South Africa following a resignation by former president Jacob Zuma. Zuma resigned on Wednesday night after being recalled by his party, and immense pressure from opposition parties. He has led the party and the country for ten years. Ramaphosa was sworn in as the new president by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, who also presided over the election. None of the opposition parties nominated a presidential candidate, leaving the house with Ramaphosa. His nomination was however opposed by Cope leader Mosioua Lekota. Lekota charged that Ramaphosa was found to be in contravention of his oath of offices, but failed to elaborate how. He said Cope intends to challenge Ramaphosa’s election as president. IFP chief whip Narend Singh also congratulated Ramaphosa but cautioned that he must act and clear out corrupt members of the cabinet and appoint a new National Prosecuting Authority head soon.
