The airport’s senior manager of corporate affairs, Deidre Davids, said the DEA had concluded the appeals process, ruling that the runway project might proceed. Construction of the runway would start next year if all processes, such as detailed design, were concluded timeously, said Davids. “This project is about growth, not only for the airport and the network of Airports Company South Africa (Acsa)  airports, but also for the region as a whole. Cape Town has every reason to celebrate.” The airport would realign the primary runway and construct parallel and rapid exit taxiways, and the realigned primary runway would be 3500m long and built to international specifications, she said. The new runway and associated infrastructure would facilitate greater air access into the city, enabling the growth of tourism and economic activity. The developments would improve access for larger aircraft with a wingspan of 65m or more, such as the Airbus A380, said Davids. Acsa would notify the DEA at least 14 days before construction of the runway realignment project started, she said. - Staff Writer
