Cape Town - Two people involved in an illegal licensing syndicate have admitted guilt and are behind bars. Len Spark, 62, was the co-owner at Korsten Vehicle Testing Station (KVTS) in Port Elizabeth, and Ayanda April, 35, worked for him. They have been linked to Belhar resident Elton Abrahams, who was busted for running an illegal licensing and police clearance operation. Abrahams provided roadworthy certification for vehicles that were not tested at a testing station. In their plea agreement Spark and April admit KVTS was one testing station that provide roadworthy certification for Abrahams. Spark said he would receive details of vehicles for which roadworthy certification was needed. This was mostly from a Raeez Carloo, he said. Carloo acted as a middleman who in turn dealt with Abrahams. Spark then made his co-owner enter the details of the vehicles onto the NaTIS system. The co-owner was made to process 1 477 vehicles onto the National Traffic Information System (NaTIS), of which 90 percent were from the Western Cape, and were not physically tested at KVTS. Spark usually received between R100 and R300 per vehicle certification. Aprils role included being party to the unlawful acts, and helped to process the vehciles. “The accused (April) also did some deals on her own and therefore received gratifications. (April) usually received R100 per vehicle certification. This was done with the permission of Spark on condition that the KVTS portion for the applications was paid,” he plea read. The duo appeared in Bellville Regional Court this week before  Magistrate Sue Smith. Spark was sentenced to five years imprisonment, plus another five years wholly suspended for five years. April was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, plus another five years wholly suspended for five years.
