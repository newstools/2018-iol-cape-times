THE SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has found education authorities are responsible for a fire that killed three pupils at the North West School for the Deaf (NWSD) in  2015. The commission this week finalised its investigation, and found the school, the Head of Department (HOD), the North West Department of Education, the Education MEC, the North West Department of Education, and the Minister of Basic Education had, among others, failed to comply with legislation and policy, including the National Building Standards. Three girls died when a fire broke out at the North West Secondary School for the Deaf in Leeudoringstad in August last year. A further 54 pupils were admitted to hospital. The Commission further found the respondents:   “ The South African Council of Educators (must) institute disciplinary proceedings, within three months of receipt of this report, against employees and/or officials of the Second Respondent (HOD, North West Department of Education), responsible for school safety who failed and/or neglected to ensure that safety measures were in place at the NWSD on 24 August 2015.  Where disciplinary measures have already been invoked - either by SACE or the Second Respondent (HOD, North West Department of Education) – that a detailed report of the disciplinary steps taken in the matter (if any) be provided to the Commission within three months of the release of this Final Investigation Report.
