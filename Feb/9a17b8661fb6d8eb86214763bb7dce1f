Cape Town - ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule has confirmed the decision on President Jacob Zuma will be taken in due course. Magashule was briefing the media in Parliament on Thursday after ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa briefed the caucus. This was a special meeting of the caucus to deal with the Zuma matter after the former began discussions with Ramaphosa on his exit. Magashule did not confirm the date of departure for Zuma, but said the matter will be concluded soon. Zuma has been in discussion with his successor in the ANC since early this week after the National Executive Committee meeting to recall Zuma was postponed. Magashule said the discussions were constructive. “The president of the ANC has released a statement to say there is constructive engagement between (him) and Zuma,” said Magashule. However, he said there was no date fixed for Zuma’s resignation. Parliament postponed the State of the Nation address after pressure from all sides that Zuma must not deliver the SONA. The SONA was due to have been held on Thursday, but has been postponed indefinitely to allow the ANC to remove Zuma. Ramaphosa has said a decision will be known in days. He said he was aware of the anxiety in the country, and a decision will be taken soon. Political Bureau
