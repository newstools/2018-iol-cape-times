The City said mass information sessions with neighbourhood watch groups and non-governmental and community organisations, as well as religious groups, are under way to brief them on the Critical Water Shortages Disaster Plan and to appeal for volunteers to assist. A session with neighbourhood watch groups was held at the weekend. Mayco member for safety and security and social services JP Smith said: “The volunteer plan has two aspects - to mobilise organisations to help us spread the message about the importance of using water sparingly, in line with the Level 6B water restrictions, but also to rally for assistance should we get to a point where we need to roll out water collection points. “This will be a mammoth undertaking and we will need as many hands on deck as possible, ensuring that it is done in a manner that is well co-ordinated and everyone knowing what is expected.” Community organisations are being asked to, among others, assist with education and awareness (saving messaging), and Day Zero preparations by identifying the most vulnerable in communities and providing assistance. Duties at collection points would include helping to set up water collection points and dispensing water, and disinfecting water dispenser pipes Organisations that want to volunteer their services will be required to complete a simple registration process.
