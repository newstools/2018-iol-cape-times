China’s ambassador to South Africa, Lin Songtian, called the claims “absurd” and stated he was disappointed local media had also written the story as fact. Lin said Le Monde had reported that an investigation discovered that the AU was a victim of state-sponsored espionage by China to spy on them. The newspaper reported that China wired the AU building because it financed and built the new building itself. It further stated that the spying was discovered in January last year when engineers in the IT division noticed an unusual spike of activity late into the evening when the building was no longer 
staffed. The revelations come as African countries will be meeting in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia to attend the 
continental summit on 
governance. Songtian said yesterday: “We are not at all surprised by such a completely fabricated report from the Le Monde and other Western media. In fact, we think such an article does deserve a response, because the Chinese people know too well what these media are 
up to. “China has never had any problems in exchanging information with African brothers and sisters, and therefore has absolutely no need to resort to such despicable and disgraceful moves used by certain countries to gather information from others. “It is sinful to do something like that.” He said certain counties, mostly Western states, “want to keep this continent (Africa) as it was, always trapped in poverty, conflicts and instability, so they can continue colonising, controlling and manipulating Africa”. “Those countries are deeply nervous about and frustrated by China’s massive scale efforts to support Africa to realise self-sustainable development. ‘“That is why they have resorted to tools of media to fabricate lies, to mislead and manipulate the public opinion,” said Songtian. He said the Western media has always viewed the relationship between China and Africa with suspicion.
