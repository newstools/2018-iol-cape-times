Pretoria - ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) members have begun arriving for the party’s meeting taking place at St George's Hotel. The special meeting was called to discuss President Jacob Zuma’s fate. NEC members such as Jackson Mthembu and Derek Hanekoem have been seen arriving at the venue in Irene, Pretoria. ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has been in ongoing discussions with Zuma to negotiate an exit plan. The last meeting the ANC top six had with Zuma last weekend, Zuma refused to resign. Last week, Ramaphosa called discussions with Zuma “fruitful”. Pressure is mounting for Zuma to step down from both anxious ANC memebers, civil society and with opposition political parties.

On Friday, it was emerged that Zuma had demanded that his legal fees be waived as part of negotiations for him to step-down. Zuma has piled on numerous cases over the years, even before he was elected president in 2009. His demand that his legal fees be paid, seems to indicate that he anticipates that he may face more legal cases. The ANC has thus far remained mum on Zuma’s future. IOL
