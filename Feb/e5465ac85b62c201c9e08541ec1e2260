South Africa's elite Hawks police unit has arrested eight people so far in its investigations into high-level influence-peddling centering around the Indian-born Gupta family, wealthy friends of ousted president Jacob Zuma, a statement said. Two other suspects were still at large in South Africa, it said, while another three - two of whom were described as "of Indian nativity" - were outside the country. Police were asking for assistance in executing the arrest warrants, it added. One of the controversial Gupta brothers‚ Atul‚ has reportedly been requested to hand himself over. Zuma and the three Gupta brothers have denied any wrongdoing. It was reported that there is tight security at the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court ahead of the appearance of the accused on Thursday. Aside from the raids at the Guptas' Saxonwold stronghold and their businesses in Midrand, homes of their co-accused were also searched in Bedfordview and in Houghton as part of the investigation into the Estina dairy project. It was meant to enable R220 million being invested in upliftment programmes for poor farmers in the Free State, but allegedly some R30 million was siphoned off to the Gupta family for an extravagant wedding in Sun City.
