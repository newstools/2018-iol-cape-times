SAHRC commissioner Chris Nissen said: “We live in a democratic country and people have the right to express their views in a responsible manner that will not infringe on the rights of others. “As the SAHRC we will access the complaint and if there is a case, act as a mediator.” Contralesa’s Eastern Cape meeting came as Ster-Kinekor was pressured to cancel screenings of the film. National executive committee member Mwelo Nokonyane said the organisation was disappointed to hear the film was shown at Cape Town’s Cavendish Square. Attempts to confirm with Ster-Kinekor if the film was showing were unsuccessful. “It is a disgrace this has been shown after we have mobilised that it should not be shown. “The film is a misrepresentation of our culture and tradition (by breaking taboo). “It depicts what is actually being done at the traditional school,” Nokonyane told the Cape Times. “This shows how the 
producers of the family are money-hungry and would do anything to have their pockets full of money at the expense of our tradition, it is totally wrong.” He said Xhosa men who had undergone the tradition knew “what happened in the mountain stays there, no matter what”. “All that is being taught in the movie is totally different from what Xhosa men know.” Nokonyane added that Contralesa would meet early this week and decide what steps should be taken about the 
theatre that screened the movie, despite the outcry.
