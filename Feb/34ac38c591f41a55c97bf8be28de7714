ABOUT 1 000 Mfuleni families will soon have serviced plots, Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille said yesterday during a site visit. The Mfuleni Extension 2 project will deliver sites with water, sanitation and electricity for 1 043 families. De Lille said the contractor has already completed the bulk earthworks and is currently installing sewer and stormwater pipes along with manholes. The project is due for completion by the end of the year. The project was initiated in 2013 when the City signed an agreement with representatives from the community. However, work was halted in 2015 due to protests and vandalism. Since then, the City has been working with residents, community leaders and councillors to ensure that we get this project up and running again.  "The continuation of the project is as a result of great collaboration between the various players and I would like to thank those involved in making it happen. The Extension 2 project is not being constructed in isolation and forms part of the City’s broader development of Mfuleni which includes a programme for 150 fully serviced sites to backyarders. A further 50 sites will be allocated to people with disabilities in Bardale, Mfuleni and surrounds," De Lille said. When that process has been completed, the title deeds for the land will be transferred to the beneficiaries as the owners of the sites. Other projects for the Mfuleni area include:   "These projects underscore the City’s commitment to enhancing service delivery as intended by the Organisational Development Transformation Plan. I have urged the community to keep up the good work relationships with subcouncil officials and the councillors to ensure we can implement this plan without delay. From the City’s side, we are committed to working with residents to ensure that that these projects are a success and improve the lives of the intended beneficiaries,"De Lille said.
