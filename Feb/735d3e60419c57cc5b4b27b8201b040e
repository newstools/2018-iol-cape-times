Len Spark, 62, was the co-owner at the Korsten Vehicle Testing Station (KVTS) in Port Elizabeth, and Ayanda April, 35, worked for him. The two have been linked to Belhar resident Elton Abrahams, who was arrested for running an illegal licensing and police clearance operation. Abrahams provided roadworthy certification for vehicles that were not tested at a testing station. Spark was sentenced to five years in prison, plus another five years suspended for five years. April was sentenced to 18 months in prison, plus another five years suspended. The pair appeared before Magistrate Sue Smith in the Bellville Regional Court this week. In their plea agreement, Spark and April admitted KVTS was a testing station that provided roadworthy certification for Abrahams. Spark said he would receive details of vehicles for which roadworthy certification was needed. This was mostly from a Raeez Carloo, he said. Carloo acted as a middleman, who in turn dealt with Abrahams. Spark then made his co-owner enter the details of the vehicles onto the National Traffic Information System (eNaTIS). The co-owner was made to process 1 477 vehicles onto the eNaTIS, of which 90% were from the Western Cape and were not physically tested at KVTS. Spark usually received between R100 and R300 per vehicle certification. April’s role included being party to the unlawful acts, and helped to process the vehicles. “The accused (April) also did some deals on her own and therefore received gratifications. (April) usually received R100 per vehicle certification," the plea read. "This was done with the permission of Spark, on condition that the KVTS portion for the applications was paid."
