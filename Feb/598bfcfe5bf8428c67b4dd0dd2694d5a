The Parliament portfolio committee on mineral resources said on Wednesday it had resolved to institute an inquiry into graft allegations against Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane after he failed to show up for a hearing. The committee said Zwane's no-show at the hearing followed an incomplete question-and-answer session last October. â€œThe committee could no longer entertain further postponements from the minister and took a decision to institute an inquiry," its chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo said. "Members had outstanding questions from the initial Q&A session and they now reserve their right to ask them during the inquiry." Zwane was implicated in a report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, which found that personal friends of former president Jacob Zuma tried to exert undue influence in the government and state-owned enterprises. Both Zuma, who stepped down last week under pressure including from his own ruling ANC party, and Zwane have denied any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, the opposition Democratic Alliance said what it called Zwane's "evasion and defensiveness" during his one previous appearance before the committee showed that "he has much to hide". "The minister has been one of the key figures implicated in state capture allegations and he must be held accountable," DA mineral resources spokesperson James Lorimer said. "Evidence of state capture has been hugely damaging to the credibility of South Africa's mining jurisdiction. It is vital to preserve the industry and the jobs it creates that we have a department and a minister who are above reproach." African News Agency (ANA)
