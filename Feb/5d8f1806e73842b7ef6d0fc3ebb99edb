On Thursday, 20 desks were delivered to the school as part of the #GOGREEN campaign in collaboration with Wildlands, Polyco and Old Mutual. Axios school principal Llewellyn Kohler said they were excited by the campaign and it tied in perfectly with recycling initiatives at the school. “Our school has it own paper and metal recycling 
programme and we also we make use of wood pallets and transform them into furniture. "We had actually begun to manufacture desks in our own workshops, after I discovered that we had a shortage and this donation is welcomed and appreciated,” said Kohler. He said they encouraged their pupils to practise recycling as they themselves were recycled after being lost within the mainstream schooling system. Polyco is a non-profit organisation that works within poorer communities and advocates not just the environmental benefits of recycling but the income 
communities can generate while giving new life to discarded materials. The #GOGREEN campaign has made almost 700  green desks created from the recycled waste and will deliver them to schools across the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Chief executive of Polyco Mandy Naude said they are in the recycling industry and strive to educate communities on the importance of recycling and cleaning their environment. “Axios was the first of 35 schools nationally who will receive 20 double green desks per school. "It roughly takes about 50kg of waste from the race and other difficult to recycle used packaging to make one double desk,” said Naude. She said they were invited to be part of this campaign and it just met all their requirements and also targeted desk shortages in South Africa. The project would not only help teach pupils and communities the benefits of recycling, said Naude, but teach that used packaging can be made into something new and doesn’t have to lie in a landfill.
