Liam Veldsman, 17, had suffered multiple stab wounds to his face and body. Liam’s grieving single mother, Melanie Veldsman, said she had tried to persuade him not to go to the shop on his bicycle. “I told him Liam come in, leave the bike at home, and he replied, yes mom, I’ll come just now. And a half-hour later he is dead. “I loved my child. He was a lovable child. He didn’t deserve to die like that. “All that I want to tell those who killed him is that God will deal with them. “Even though they might get away with it, they won’t get away from God,” said 
Veldsman. Veldsman was being consoled by a number of relatives, including her mother, Virginia Veldsman. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident, saying that “the circumstances surrounding a murder are being investigated after the body of a 17-year-old male was discovered in Grindal Avenue, Lavender Hill". "No one has been arrested as yet.” Anyone with information is requested to contact Crime Line on 0860010111.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za  Cape Times
