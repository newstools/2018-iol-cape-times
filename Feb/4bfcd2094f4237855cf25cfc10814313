The Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday expressed their concern over the delay in determining President Jacob Zuma's fate, but still welcomed the decision to postpone the State of the Nation address. President of the Chamber Janine Myburgh said: "The indications are that the president will resign and this has lifted the mood of business and the country. Our concern is the delay. "Throughout his career, President Zuma has used delaying tactics to buy time and we must ask how he intends to use this time and whether he could do further damage to the country and the economy." Myburgh pointed out that at the ANC national elective conference in December Zuma had unilaterally promised free tertiary education without any plan or budget for it.

It will be interesting to see what his successor plans to do on this issue. "This makes it essential for him (Zuma) to leave office without delay and before he can sign anything,"Â Myburgh added. According to Myburgh, there was reason for concern about the negotiations and the concessions that might have to be made in order to secure Zuma's exit and the message this may relay to the world. Myburgh added: "The message has to be one of accountability and that there will be consequences for those who have enriched themselves at the expense of the poor and the taxpayer. Anything else will just not do." African News Agency/ANA
