Transformational therapist Shaldon Fitzgerald said: “Stress is a survival instinct, designed to keep us alive, so it can be a useful tool. It’s not something we are ever going to fully be able to overcome, so the only way to look after our well-being is to forge a better relationship with stress. “The only people who don’t have stress are those living lives going sideways, and those people are few and far between, because most of us are either going up or down and either way it’s stressful.” Fitzgerald provided some insight into how to better manage stress for a positive relationship with it rather than a negative one. He said change was one of the most stressful things for people. “Change is inevitable and is perceived by the mind as life-threatening. “If there is change happening in an area of your life, try to keep things in other areas of your life as consistent as possible, ie stick with your routine. “This way, in the midst of the disruptive change you may be experiencing at work, you have a safe space at home to relax and unwind.” South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) operations director Cassey Chambers said: “When stress does occur, it is important to recognise and deal with it.”
