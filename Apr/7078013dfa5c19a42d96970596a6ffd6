The parastatal experienced 3 432 incidents of cable and pylon theft worth about R60m last year. In the Western Cape, there were 249 vandalism cases and 254 reported cable theft incidents, which resulted in a bill of R7.5m. Eskom social development project manager Thandi Nkonzo said 
criminals were cutting down overhead cable and digging for underground cable, removing it and also breaking into sub-stations. Between July last year and February, stolen and vandalised infrastructure had cost the City R7.9m, according to the Mayco member for energy, Xanthea Limberg. “The City has dealt with 4569 cases of electricity tampering and 3000 cable theft cases for the same period. “Accounts were adjusted to the value of some R75m after it was found that customers had tampered with infrastructure to get electricity without paying for it. “This excludes R28m worth of contravention notices issued.” Limberg said the vandalism of network infrastructure and public lighting was sharply on the increase, resulting in a disruption of, and an increase in, the cost of electricity services. This had caused extensive service disruption and serious safety concerns for staff, Limberg added. “The City’s electricity generation department is committed to combating this scourge by enclosing mini-substation equipment in 
protective cages, using more robust locking mechanisms on street furniture installed in high-vandalism areas and using CCTV cameras and alarms at sub-station buildings. “This could also include the pooling of resources with other utility departments which are also affected by vandalism, especially for the provision of armed response teams,” Limberg said. Hot spots last year were Joe Slovo in Milnerton, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Philippi West and Weltevreden Valley. To report metal theft, call 080 0222 771 or 021 400 2828.
