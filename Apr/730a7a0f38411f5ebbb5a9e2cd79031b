Hermanus police arrested 81 people over the four days of violent protests, which saw the torching of a satellite police station, an attack on a library and the looting of spaza shops mostly belonging to Somalis. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “Police are monitoring the situation at the court. A group of about 1 500 people were protesting for the release of the suspects who were arrested for public violence and were appearing in court.” Zwelihle community leader Sivuyile Wana said that only a few members were allowed to enter court, but the community waited outside the court to show their support “Proceedings were delayed because some of the people’s information was not on record and our community had to help get that information for the docket. They could not all appear together and had to go in stages as all of them could not fit in the dock at the same time,” said Wana. He said their protest had begun peacefully, but turned chaotic after police allegedly shot at them with rubber bullets and tear gas. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the bail application was rolled over to today. “An interpreter had to come out of town, resulting in the matter starting late. Both parties (had) agreed, but emphasised that we start at 9am. All 11 accused were remanded. “Another 29 accused appeared, who also face charges relating to public violence and damage to property,” said Ntabazalila. He said the charges against two accused were withdrawn and the bail application had been postponed to tomorrow morning.
