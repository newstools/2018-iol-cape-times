This after the killing of a Bishop Lavis mother-of-five, who was shot through the window of her home. None of the family members have received counselling following the incident on April 5. According to the family, it was not the first time the suspect had attacked them, as he allegedly broke into the home two weeks prior and sexually abused a 4-year-old girl. The suspect has since been arrested. A family member, who did not want to be named, said: “We still feel very sad. He took a piece of us. We are struggling and we are in fear because even though the suspect was arrested, his gang associates are threatening our family. "It’s nerve-racking because you don’t know if you’ll be safe when you put your foot outside the door.” Sonke Gender Justice executive director Dean Peacock said: “People exposed to violence need psychosocial support to be made available to them by trained professionals. "Research shows clearly that good counselling services decrease the symptoms and negative consequences of trauma, and help people to recover from it. “We have very few counselling services available in South Africa and not nearly enough school 
social workers, psychologists or lay counsellors. "We need an urgent plan to increase the availability of such 
services in the community, at schools and in general.” Peacock said the government did not to do enough to address the root cause of such violence. “The government does not do enough to address the root causes of violence - such as commonly held beliefs that violence is an appropriate way to discipline children, or the patriarchal beliefs that men should control and have the final say over women’s lives and choices, or the poverty, unemployment, alcohol abuse also associated with the 
perpetration of violence.”
