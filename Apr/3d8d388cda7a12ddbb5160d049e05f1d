Carlo de Kock, her uncle, appeared via video conference form Pollsmoor Prison while Stanton Mano appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court yesterday morning. Previously the duo applied for bail but it was denied as magistrate Goolam Bawa said the acts were “barbaric”. De Kock and Mano will appear via video conference at Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on June 13 for further investigation and where a high court date will be confirmed. Charnelle was found at a wetlands in Manenberg on October 21 last year - a day after being reported missing. She was wrapped in a plastic bag and a curtain. A forensics report showed she suffered multiple blunt-force injuries to her head, neck and genital areas. DNA testing revealed semen traces found on her pants. At a previous court appearance, the State detailed how both accused were watching pornographic videos the day of Charnelle’s disappearance. The material has been seized by the police. The State said it would be revisiting two sexual assault cases against De Kock. Bawa previously said: “The accused has two previous convictions for theft and drugs. “He was previously charged on two occasions for sexual assault on his daughter. These cases were withdrawn and will now be revisited.” It was confirmed De Kock’s wife would be a State witness.
