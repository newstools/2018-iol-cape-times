Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has died, a family spokesman confirmed on Monday afternoon. She was 81. "It is with profound sadness that we inform the public that Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela passed away at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on Monday," family spokesman Victor Dlamini said. "She died after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year. "She succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones., according to reports from various media houses in South Africa and abroad."  Madikizela-Mandela had been in and out of hospital these last few months, with her last hospitalisation for a kidney infection. Dlamini called on people to celebrate the life of Madikizela-Mandela, who's also affectionately referred to as "Mother of the Nation". "The Mandela family are deeply grateful for the gift of her life and even as our hearts break at her passing, we urge all those who loved her to celebrate this most remarkable woman." The family said details of her memorial and funeral services would be released one they have been finalised. Madikizela-Mandela was the ex-wife of Nelson Mandela and an icon of the anti-apartheid struggle in her own right. Retired South African archbishop and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu hailed her as "a defining symbol of the struggle against apartheid". "She refused to be bowed by the imprisonment of her husband, the perpetual harassment of her family by security forces, detentions, bannings and banishment," he said. "Her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to me, and to generations of activists." African News Agency (ANA)
