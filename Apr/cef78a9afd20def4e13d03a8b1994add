Mapila was shot and killed in front of her two children and pupils on Wednesday. The perpetrator is believed to have been her ex-husband. After the man killed Mapila, he ran off the school premises and killed himself. Police found his body with a gunshot wound to the head. A teacher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she saw Mapila running around her car trying to avoid shots fired by the man. But as much as she wanted to help, there was nothing she could do for Mapila. “It was around 7.55am when teachers went to fetch their bags in their cars. At first I thought the gunshots were something the children were playing with, but then I saw what was happening and I saw her running around her car.” Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said the pupils and Mapila’s two children who witnessed the incident had been traumatised and were receiving counselling. “The school made the decision to dismiss pupils early, and a school psychologist and social worker will be dispatched to provide counselling for those who are in need of assistance or witnessed the event,” Schäfer said. “I am deeply disturbed 
by the unspeakably tragic incident.” Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said they were investigating a case of murder and an inquest was opened. Cape Times
