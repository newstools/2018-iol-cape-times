Speakers described Madikizela-Mandela as loving, fearless, courageous, outspoken and a humble human being. President Nelson Mandela’s grandson, Mandla Mandela, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete, ANC NEC member Naledi Pandor, ANC stalwarts and veterans joined the scores of people at the service. The party in the Western Cape had earlier invited members of the public to visit the ANC provincial office and the six regional offices across the province to write their tributes to maWinnie and their own reflections on the meaning of her life and legacy. Mbete told the gathering: “We know there was a lot she could contribute to various communities but her health was not good.” She said Madikizela-Mandela had not attended Parliament for years, “not because she was lazy but because she was not well”. She said the chief whips of various political parties had come together and agreed that she should be excused from her parliamentary duties. Mbete further told the mourners that it was upsetting that there were people “speaking ill” about Madikizela-Mandela. “It is very bad to talk ill of someone who has not even been buried, that is very un-
African. When a person has died we should show respect,” said Mbete. “I am very happy that Stompie's mother is coming to the funeral,” she added. Mandla Mandela said: “Mam Winnie has been a shining sun, a guiding star, an immovable mountain, a mother to generations of freedom fighters. Not even years of banishment to Brandfort could silence her. "They tried everything, even burning down her house; but she proved why she is regarded as 'mother of the nation', unwavering, resilient and irrepressible and always at the heart of the Struggle.” He said maWinnie’s name was echoing in Gaza and other parts of Palestine. “It is our collective duty to stand for the poor, the voiceless and the landless; South Africa awaits the radical economic transformation that our freedom and new democracy has promised,” he said.
