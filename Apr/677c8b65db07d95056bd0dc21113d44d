Cele was addressing community members in Nonziba Street in Brown’s Farm, Philippi, on Thursday. He said police were following up on leads. He also asked that community members give police the space to carry out the investigation and that people with information come forward. On Tuesday at 9.30pm four people - Sinethemba Gwatiso, 30, Sazi Velebhayi, 20, Yonela Sxiki, 13, and Kamvalethu Thutani, 12 - were murdered in a parked Toyota Avanza vehicle.

She saw the men flee in a white Corolla. Cele visited the grieving families on Wednesday.    He said it was important to visit the community as well. “What kind of person fires five shots at a 12-year-old? Nobuhle saw something terrible. When I went to visit the family she was trembling; she couldn’t sleep.    “We are following leads, but we will not divulge much because we fear that some people may alert the murderers,” he said. Cele said he was on a mission to clear Nyanga of its status as SA's murder capital. He said his department was going to focus on the townships and Cape Flats, where crime and gangsterism was rife. “This space belongs to innocent communities, citizens like yourself. We will be very hard on criminals. We will work hard that is our commitment to the community here.  We will find the person who killed our children here, we will find thieves and we will get rid of the high murders in this place,” he said.    @Zoey_Dano  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
