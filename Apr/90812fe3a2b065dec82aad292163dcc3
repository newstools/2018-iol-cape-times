She is among a group of young models competing in Pretoria. The competition began 
yesterday. The soft-spoken and shy Grade 3 pupil from Eluxolweni Primary School in Khaye­litsha is excited to be part of this contest. Her mother, Brenda Mamputha, could not be more proud. Kwakho is not new to modelling. She first impressed scouts from the International Presentation of Performers during auditions 
which were held in Camps Bay early last year. She attended workshops in Joburg and flew to New York to model. Brenda said Kwakho's modelling was improving and she was gaining confidence every time she was called to do a job. “She is excited about the trip. “She is not only representing Cape Town, but her community of Khayelitsha where she comes from. “Her participating in these kinds of events will also show and encourage other 
young people to take part,” she said. “Kwakho is showing that anything is possible despite one's circumstances and the environment one grows up 
in. “People have been sending messages of support, and we are grateful to everyone who supported her and voted for her,” said Brenda. She added that her daughter had started modelling at the age of 4. Any money she received from her modelling career will go towards her ultimate dream of becoming a doctor. However, Brenda fears the lack of funds for travelling and accommodation might derail her child's dreams. Brenda is the recipient of the last year's City of Cape Town Safe 
City Award for establishing a soup kitchen that provides 700 meals a week for needy children in Khayelitsha.
