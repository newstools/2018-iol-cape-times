Colin was murdered after he, his wife of 16 years Chantal, and two female friends had gone to Mnandi Beach shortly after 1am on Sunday. The father of three girls was shot through the driver’s window and dragged from the car while his friend who sat with him was tossed out of the vehicle. According to her family, Chantal and the other friend had gone down to the water “to wet their feet”. The women heard the shots and ran into the bushes to get help. But Chantal apparently got lost and was found hours later by police where the traumatised woman was hiding in bushes. Chantal’s mother, Shirley Sawyer, describes Colin as “an amazing person”. “He was funny, outgoing and he always had a joke or two. His girls are coping, and he will be dearly missed.” Daily Voice
