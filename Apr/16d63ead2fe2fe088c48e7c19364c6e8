Cape Town - Sagamartha Technologies will consider alternative listing options in the wake of their non-listing on JSE. Sekunjalo chairman Dr Iqbal Survé said in an interview with the SABC. Survé says that the campaign to thwart the listing by competitors was "anti-transformation". He said that the management team at Sagamartha were highly skilled and brought a wealth of experience to the table.   Survé says that his support of broad-based black participation in the economy "scared the crap" out of certain established interests in South Africa.
