Theo Erasmus, the NSRI Witsand Port Beaufort station commander, said they received reports of a red distress flare seen coming from San Sebastian Bay last Friday. Rescuers then searched slipway launching sites for trailers that might have belonged to a boat. “The sea rescue craft Breede Rescuer was launched to conduct a sea search of the bay area. "Despite an extensive search of the bay nothing was found and there remains no report of anyone or any craft overdue or missing,” Erasmus said. In Plettenberg Bay, a hiker injured her knee while walking the Robberg Nature Reserve. The NSRI Plettenberg Bay deputy station commander, Robbie Gibson, said the hiker, 18, was with family at the time. The Sea rescue craft Leonard Smith and Free Runner were launched.
