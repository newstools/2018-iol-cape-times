Residents brought Prince George Drive to a standstill on Monday when they set tyres and other debris alight and attacked vehicles. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said: “Three motor vehicles were stoned and a liquor store at Capricorn Square was looted and damaged. Three cases of malicious damage to property were opened. “For the damaged vehicles, a case of public violence was registered after two male suspects, aged 16 and 34, were arrested on the roof of 
a spaza shop.” He said a case of business robbery and public violence was also opened for the looting of the liquor store. A 27-year-old woman was arrested and detained at Muizenberg police station. Police and law enforcement remained in the area to monitor the situation. Vrygrond resident Nomathamsa Nomtshongwana, 42, said residents became angry after officials visited a piece of land called “Xakabantu Land”. “This land is meant for us and they told us this land is not for black people we must go live under a bridge. I have been living here for 20 years as a backyarder. “I am unemployed and have five children and have 
to pay R800 for rent each month. We are all tired of waiting. “The City has for more than 20 years made us promises and failed us.” Ward councillor Gerry Gordon visited the township and addressed the community on the responses she received from the City. She said the land did not belong to the City and a court battle was continuing over the ownership. This angered the residents, who demanded to speak to the mayor herself. Gordon confirmed that the mayor would speak to a leadership group. De Lille’s spokesperson, Zara Nicholson, said: “The mayor is committed to working with the community of Vrygrond to find solutions. “She  is, however, clear that the meeting cannot go ahead while people continue to illegally occupy land and affect the lives of other residents by blocking roads.”
