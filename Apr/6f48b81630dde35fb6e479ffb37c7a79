A 40-year-old suspected arsonist was arrested after four separate fires were started on Table Mountain's slopes yesterday. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said the man was found with petrol and other fire-making devices.
The suspect is known in the area. "A lot of people have identified him. He was screaming his head off and clearly at the location where the four fires started so people suspected it may be him," said Smith. Firefighters were dispatched to Tafelberg Road just after noon. Two fire engines and a water tanker were on the ground, while two helicopters were assisting from above. Smith said two choppers and two fire engines were on the scene, including a water tanker. Table Mountain National Parks assisted firefighters. Spokesperson for the City of Cape Town’s fire and rescue services Theo Layne said the “large vegetation fire” was on the upper slopes of the mountain above the lower cable way station.
