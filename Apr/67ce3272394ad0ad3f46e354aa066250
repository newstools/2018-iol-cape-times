The rain over the Easter weekend has pushed up dam levels slightly in the Western Cape to 22.2 percent. Dam levels for the province stood at 18.3 percent last week, compared with 19 percent the week before, according to the Department of Water Affairs. The Theewaterskloof and Voelvlei dams still hover ominously at 10.6 and 14.4 percent respectively. In contrast, water levels of the Steenbras Upper (80 percent), Berg River (44.7) and Wemmershoek (44 percent) provide more comfort. The City of Cape Town said on its website that Day Zero had been "pushed out to 2019", with daily consumption restrictions still standing at 50 litres per person per day. Elsewhere, the water situation has been improving, with dam levels rising, Reuters reported. An El Nino-triggered drought two years ago hit agricultural production and economic growth throughout the country. Cape Town was particularly hard hit. The Vaal Dam, a major supply source for Gauteng, was at 94.7 percent, up from 83.5 percent the week before. Levels in the Katse and Mohale dams in neighbouring Lesotho, which are key water storage systems for Gauteng, have a combined capacity now of almost 54 percent. In late January, they were at 32 percent, raising concerns that the water crisis would spread beyond Cape Town. Relief for Cape Town may also be imminent, with good seasonal rains forecast. Cape Town typically gets rain starting around May. Above average rainfall is now forecast over the next three months, according to the latest seasonal outlook from the South African Weather Service.
