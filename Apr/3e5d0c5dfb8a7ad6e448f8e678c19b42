I remembered what I set out to do and had to really control my movements when cramping started to set in at around 46km. "The pain was almost unbearable but I kept my focus and kept my thinking positive. “I kept composure and ran through the cramps and pain. “At around 50km the cramps actually went away and I could regain my normal speed. All in all it was a great time to finish. "The lessons I’ve learnt for both the students and myself was that life is about enduring the pain,” Fortune said.
