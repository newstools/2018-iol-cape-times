JOHANNESBURG - Hundreds of workers draped in red on Wednesday mocked President Cyril Ramaphosa, accusing him of short changing South African workers. The workers gathered in Newton, Johannesburg to heed a call by the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) for a nationwide strike against a proposed R20 per hour minimum wage. Some of the marchers hoisted up replicas of the buffalo, one of South Africa's big five animals, a snide indirect attack on Ramaphosa, a wealthy former businessman who once purchased a buffalo for R2 million. Most of the workers were members of theÂ National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and other unions affiliated to Saftu.
