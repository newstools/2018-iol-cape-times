The City of Cape Town is rolling out further pressure testing across the metro in an effort to help reduce water usage to 50 litres per person per day and beat the drought. By creating automated pressure zones, we will be able to adjust water pressure remotely and work more efficiently. The work is scheduled to take place on Thursday from 10pm to 4am and will affect Andrews Street and the high-lying areas above this street; the Baviaanskloof area, and Military Heights next to Chapman's Peak. The City continues to roll out automated pressure zones for the implementation of pressure management. This technology reduces the flow of water and thus helps to reduce water usage. To install an automated pressure zone, the City needs to test the integrity of the local reticulation network. We have recently successfully tested areas including the Cape Town CBD, Green Point, Paarden Eiland, Woodstock, Salt River, Epping, Delft, Brooklyn and Dunoon. Testing is happening across the metro. The pressure management programme started in 2004. There are more than 115 automated pressure zones across the city which are being prioritised based on their leak and burst rates. Areas with high water pressure typically experience more leaks and bursts. At least 25 other areas across the city have been identified that could benefit from this technology and will be informed of necessary supply disruptions related to this work in due course. Affected areas are requested not to stockpile large volumes of municipal water as the service interruptions are not expected to be in effect for long periods.
