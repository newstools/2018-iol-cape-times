Cape Town - The City of Cape Town is lending its full co-operation to the South African Police Service (SAPS) following a shooting incident involving a metro police officer at the Mfuleni police station on Sunday morning, the city said. Approximately at 11.30am, a Cape Town Metro Police officer was registering a case docket at the police station when a member of the public arrived, mayoral committee member for safety and security, and social services JP Smith said. "The man appeared agitated and indicated that he wants to be arrested. He turned to speak to the metro police officer before taking out a knife and stabbing the officer twice in the chest and once in his left arm. The officer retaliated by discharging three rounds from his service pistol, fatally wounding the suspect. Two other civilians sustained wounds - both to the right foot - as a result of ricocheting bullets," he said. The metro police officer was treated at Bellville Melomed Hospital and would receive counselling as part of the cityâ€™s employee assistance programme. One of the two civilians wounded was transported to Tygerberg Hospital for treatment. "We wish both a speedy recovery." The SAPS was investigating the matter, as was the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. The city would assist in any way possible to ensure that the investigation into this matter was expedited, Smith said. African News Agency
