The man was caught in the act by community members when he raped the child, with whom he shared the same address in July last year, according to police spokesperson Andre Traut. “The Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court handed down a lengthy sentence to a 51-year-old man who was convicted for rape. Community members reacted to the victim’s plea for help during the incident and informed the police. “The suspect was arrested shortly afterwards and, following a thorough investigation, the investigating officer from the Kuilsriver FCS, Sergeant Ettiene Lerm, presented the court with the fully prepared case docket,” said Traut. He said the 18 years’ direct imprisonment sentence was welcomed by the Western Cape police, and trusted that it would serve as a deterrent for crimes against women and children. Mfuleni community policing forum chairperson Bongani Tyembile said crimes against the most vulnerable should not be tolerated and the man was no longer welcome in the community. “We cannot live with idiots like that. He belongs in jail and should stay there. He is old enough to be the child’s grandfather. He was a father figure. “We have no doubt that this court decision and the good work done by the police will, once again, send a clear message to rapists that the long arm of the law will always catch up with them. "The outcome of the case is welcomed by the entire Mfuleni community.” Ilitha Labantu spokesperson Siyabulela Monakali also welcomed the sentencing, as the organisation had been fighting the gross violation of human rights and violence against women and children for over 29 years. “We appeal to the judicial system to treat all cases of violence against women and children with a great sense of urgency, and that perpetrators should be given lengthy sentences to send out a message to society that rape and all forms of violence perpetrated on women and children shall not be tolerated,” said Monakali.
