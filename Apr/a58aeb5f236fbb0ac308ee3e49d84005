Johannesburg - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) on TuesdayÂ urged South Africans to down tools and support the national strike against the R20 minimum wage hourly rate. "Government has already imposed VAT, sugar tax, fuel levy and all other manner of taxes to resolve an economic crisis that the workers did not create," the EFF said in a statement. "The very same government proposes that the national minimum wage for all workers should be R20 per hour, even less than the minimum living wage that was in the findings of a research from UCT in 2014."

Saftu has slammed the planned national minimum wage of R20 per hour, or R3 500 a month, as well as amendments to labour laws. The union federation is also angry over economic hardships facing workers and the poor. Cosatu has distanced itself from the strike, saying that it supports the minimum wage tabled.
