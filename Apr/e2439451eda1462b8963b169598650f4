The South African tourism industry is currently at a level of competing at the highest levels in the world in terms of guest experience, innovation and provision of world-class services. This is according to Chris Alexandre, founder and chief executive of application company, GuestRevu which develops and sells a web-based application to enable hospitality businesses to monitor and manage their guest experience and online reputation, and one of Platinum TripAdvisor partners in the world. At the World Travel Market (WTM) held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) on Friday, Alexandre said that properties needed to monitor their guests' reviews and be aware of their reputation as turning a blind eye could lead to running at a risk of losing clients. “Most bookings for hotels today are made after extensive searches for reviews on the property. Those properties who are not aware of their online reputation, and who do not monitor guest reviews, run the risk of losing clients to those properties that are actively managing their online reputation,” he said. He said that GuestRevu attended WTM to meet existing clients, enhance relationships, and to meet new clients in an effort to transform the SA tourism industry into a much higher competitive less to that of the world. “GuestRevu is the provider of choice for up to 80 percent of the major hotel chains and independent hotels engaged in managing guest experience in South Africa. "The trade show engagements enable the company to meet with their new and existing clients, identify topical trends, understand pertinent client concerns and issues, and plan additional features and functions that add more value to the suite of services,” said Alexandre. “Properties that invest in applications to help them collect and understand guest experience are able to perform to a far higher level than their competitors, and are able to generate a higher return visitor percentage, as well as a higher direct booking and referral rate.” African News Agency (ANA)
