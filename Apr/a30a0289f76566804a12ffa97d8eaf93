This after Jordaan’s lawyers released a statement saying they would take the matter to the National Prosecuting Authority as attempts to engage with the police had been fruitless and the lack information was damaging to Jordaan. National police spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo said: “Sexual-related matters are extremely sensitive. “This is a sensitive investigation and we will not and cannot say anything in the public domain. “We have to protect the integrity of the complainant and cannot release the identity of the suspect until the matter is in court.” Jordaan’s lawyer, Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi, said: “It is almost a month (since) we learnt in a press report that Jennifer Ferguson had laid a complaint against Mr Danny Jordaan about an alleged 
incident more than 20 years ago. “Despite numerous attempts to contact authorities, including two letters directed to the SA Police Service, we have been unable to (obtain) any information about the whereabouts of the docket. “The lack of information is damaging to our client. We reiterate that Ms Ferguson’s allegations are absolutely unfounded and untrue, and that her true motives are deeply suspect.” Ferguson could not be reached for comment.
