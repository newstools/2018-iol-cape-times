“Well done, youth squad. 
I would also like to express my special appreciation to MJ Li. “He is a South African kung fu star. What moved me most, he is actively promoting Chinese kung fu in Cape Town. “He is teaching young kids the Chinese Wu Shu without any charge. “His efforts have helped to open a new door, leading 
those young people to the rich Chinese culture and a door leading the young kids to China. “As a diplomat based in South Africa, my primary duty is to work on the enhancement of understanding and friendship between the people of South Africa and China. Thus I regard MJ Li’s efforts as particularly meaningful.” The team of 18 male and female athletes, ranging from 10 to 17 years old, were the first South African youth team to take part in the competition, alongside 9000 athletes from about 52 countries. The team was led by Legends of Kung Fu Champion Muhammad MJ Li Chafeker, who trained them and assisted in fund-raising for the championships. “The reception was fantastic," he said. "I am humbled."  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
