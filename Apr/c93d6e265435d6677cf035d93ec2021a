The Green Point Athletics Stadium was a hive of activity as about 4200 seniors from sports clubs across the city participated in various track and field events  yesterday. It was a priceless sight as the faces of the elderly lit up when music was played, with some leaving their crutches and walking sticks to dance. To honour maWinnie Madikizela-Mandela, the national anthem was also sung. “I am very happy today. It was beautiful. I have started to celebrate my birthday. “Back in the day, this was just a field and we used to come and play here. This has also brought back good memories,” said Pieterson. Proving age is just a number, another participant, Esther Benjamin, 90, from Manenberg, said she had great fun at this year’s Games and participated in basketball, wheelchair pegging and other field events. The City, which hosts the Games, partnered with other organisations including the provincial department of health, which assisted with health screening and related advice and focused on socio-economic issues that impact on the lives of older persons. Mayco member for safety, security and social services JP Smith said the Games form part of the City’s objective to raise awareness about services available to older persons and to promote healthy living and active ageing. “About 60% of the people participated in the field and track events. The remainder were spectators supporting their clubs. All participants are older than 60 years. “This  annual event forms part of the Social Development and Early Childhood Development Department’s programmes for older persons,” he said.
