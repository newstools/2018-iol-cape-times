She has turned to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) for justice. Thandile Yalalo worked as a customer service consultant for the Collinson Group - 
a UK company with a branch in Century City. She said she was given a notice to appear before a disciplinary hearing after she was charged for failure or refusal to carry out a reasonable instruction. Yalalo said the charge was twofold: she spoke isiXhosa to fellow colleagues and ate in the workspace. Yalalo, shocked by the notice, said she defended her right to speak her mother tongue. Yalalo said she was told
by the company’s human resources officer that she showed no remorse during the disciplinary hearing. “Why must I show remorse for speaking my mother tongue in my country? “I spoke Xhosa to a colleague while I was on my way out. How can I be charged for speaking isiXhosa in a country where we have 11 official languages?” Yalalo asked. Yalalo said her boss once jokingly asked staff to teach him to speak Xhosa. “I was not on a call or busy with work duties when I spoke in Xhosa,” she said. About the eating while in office charge, Yalalo said the rule was inconsistent because when the workload becomes too busy, Yalalo said they were told they may eat at their desks. “I suffer from recurring ulcers, for which I often end up in hospital, and needed to take my medication. “I was not eating a meal, I ate chips so that I could take my medication,” Yalalo said. The Collinson Group responded to a Cape Times query, saying: “The matter is currently before the CCMA and therefore sub judice. “The Collinson Group fully reserves the right not to make any statement or comment until the matter is finalised.” The CCMA said: “This is dismissal dispute referred to the CCMA for dispute resolution purposes. “Conciliation was heard on March 7 but the dispute remained unresolved after conciliation. “We have not yet received a referral to arbitration.”  francesca.villette@inl.co.za
