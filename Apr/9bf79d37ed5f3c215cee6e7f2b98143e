One of the weekend’s deadliest accidents was reported on Friday when seven people were killed in a collision between a train and a bakkie at the Buttskop level crossing in Blackheath. It’s the same level crossing at which 10 children were killed in August 2010 when a taxi driven by Jacob Humphreys collided with a train. The Railway Safety Regulator (RSR), which is investigating the incident, also announced that safety standards at level crossings across the country would be reviewed. “The bakkie was following a taxi on Frederick Road, parallel to the railway track approaching the Buttskop Level Crossing,” the RSR said. “As the train was approaching the crossing, the taxi drove across and the bakkie followed the taxi but was unfortunately hit by the train. The level crossing is protected by boom gates and flashing lights. “We are looking at strengthening the enforcement that needs to happen at level crossings. We will be looking at the minimum protection that is needed at level crossings across the country,” RSR added. Provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said a 24-year-old female passenger was killed when a driver lost control of his vehicle on the R62 near Ladismith in the Little Karoo on Saturday. Later that day three people were killed and three others injured on the R364 near Lamberts Bay at the Leipoldtville turn-off. “Two females and one male in a light vehicle were killed when their vehicle was side swiped by a bakkie. In the bakkie two were seriously injured while one had slight injuries,” said Africa. A pedestrian was killed during an alleged hit-and-run on the R27 about 20km outside Langebaan. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said eight people were injured when a bakkie crashed into a wall off the Old Paarl road in Brackenfell yesterday. “No serious injuries or fatalities were found on the scene.”
