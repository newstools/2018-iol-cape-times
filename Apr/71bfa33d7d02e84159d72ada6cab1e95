Ntombizodwa Chiya, 51, who like her late father and aunts was born blind, graduated with an Honours degree in education. Accounting lecturer Dr Anita Hiralaal, 53, of Pietermaritzburg, overcame great obstacles on her path to achieving her PhD in education (teacher development studies). The blind and single Chiya lost her parents at a young age, but was excited that her son, Siyabulela Mtolo, and her nephew, Khumbulani Shibe, witnessed her 
graduation. “Most people who are blind don’t consider themselves on the same level as able-bodied people. This thinking must stop. "We are capable of so much. Our loss of sight should not stop us from achieving our dreams. Blind people should educate themselves, and not see themselves as burdens,” Chiya said. Having encountered challenges in her research, Chiya relied mainly on electronic means, such as e-books and a software application on her computer that read out parts of journal articles. “I’m busy with my Master's degree in social justice, with the aim of establishing a new organisation for students with blindness and 
visual impairment,” she said. Similarly, Hiralaal overcame great obstacles during her doctoral studies, as her husband died in 2011 and she suffered a stroke that affected her sight and co-ordination. The mother of two said: “Due to the stroke, I spent some time in hospital as I needed intense treatment. “My sabbatical leave was spent getting occupational therapy, physiotherapy and psychological counselling. “In this time, I still had to manage my late husband’s business and my household. "It was a very difficult time. Nevertheless I had to be brave, and I realised that I had an inner strength that kept me optimistic and courageous.” Despite her challenges, she worked extremely hard and devoted a great deal of time and effort to her research and the writing that earned her a PhD, she said.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
