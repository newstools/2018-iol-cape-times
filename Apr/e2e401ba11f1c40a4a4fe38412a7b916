English, from Strandfontein, said he wrote the song especially for 
Nelson Mandela. “I will definitely make mention of the legacy of maWinnie at my acceptance speech,” he said. Mayor Patricia de Lille has congratulated English for receiving the Georgia State University’s 40 people under-40 Most Influential and Innovative Award in Atlanta, US, about two weeks ago. He also won the 2018 Global Peace Song (jazz category), is a two-time recipient of the Fine Music Radio Award and his album Imagine Nation was on the official ballot for the 2017 Grammy Awards. His album was nominated for best jazz album in the South African Music Awards. “Darren, you are an inspiration to many young musicians from across our beautiful city and country,” wrote De Lille on her Facebook timeline. Speaking to the Cape Times yesterday, English said: “Seeing mayor Patricia de Lille’s message, congratulating me, I read it over and over, 
and I couldn’t believe the mayor 
had given me such a wonderful 
write-up. “It makes me feel so extremely excited and I’m ever grateful,” 
he said. “My inspiration to choose music as a career is a continuing inspiration and having the ability to connect people of all colours, creeds or races through music.”
