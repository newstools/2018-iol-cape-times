This was clearly shown by findings of a R1million impact study of the area, DA provincial Economic Opportunities, Tourism and Agriculture spokesperson Beverley Schäfer said yesterday after the provincial Department of Agriculture briefed the Standing Committee on Economic Opportunities, Tourism, and Agriculture on the findings. According to the study, the opportunity for this land to become a productive, sustainable, and inclusive space could be achieved through a whole of society approach. “This committee has always stood by the fact that unique sites such as the PHA provide a competitive advantage to emerging black farmers, providing direct access to a burgeoning agricultural market. There is immense potential to provide an opportunity for emerging black farmers to become part of the international agricultural supply chain through the PHA,” Schäfer said. During the first half of the briefing, ANC MPL Cameron Dugmore raised an objection to Schäfer’s refusal to allow members of the public to ask questions. “Presentations and questions from MPL’s were concluded by 10.30am Members of the public wanted to ask questions, but were not allowed to do so by Schäfer,” he had said. After a short break, Schäfer then apparently allowed for members of the public in attendance to ask questions. “The public who attended today’s committee have been fully engaged with throughout the course of the study. “Contrary to claims by the ANC, the public was permit-
ted to participate fully, and
did so extensively at the end of the presentation,” Schäfer said.
