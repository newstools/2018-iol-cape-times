Police spokesperson Andre Traut said: “Following the murder of a 4-year-old girl in an incident believed to be gang-related, Operation Combat members and detectives embarked on a tracing operation overnight to apprehend those responsible. At 4.30am they arrested two suspects, both aged 21, on a murder charge,” he said. The suspects will appear in court soon. Ravensmead Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson David Olivier said the girl was standing in the backyard of a block of flats when she was hit by a stray bullet. “The incident occurred in the afternoon around 1. The attack was not on her family home, instead she was caught in crossfire when rivals gangs were shooting in the area,” he said. Uitsig residents said their plea for a satellite police station should not fall on deaf ears, especially in light of this latest incident. Olivier said the Ravensmead police station was too under-resourced to deal with crime in the area. “The situation in Uitsig can easily be compared to the conditions in Lavender Hill and Hanover Park when it comes to gang-related shootings. “We have shootings here every second day. “People may not hear of the shootings in these areas as much as they do about the other areas where gang violence continues, but Uitsig is considered a no-go area. “Concerns about gang violence have been raised numerous times in CPF meetings,” Olivier said. Olivier said Ravensmead police station serviced a large area in a community which was more than 50 years old. “We have recently engaged with the department of community safety to urge them to bring a satellite police station to the area. “It is unfortunate that this had to happen to the little girl, but we hope police and the authorities take heed of our call for more resources in the area to prevent more killings,” Olivier said.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
