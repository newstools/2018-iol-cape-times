Gun-wielding robbers stormed Newlands Cricket Stadium, targeting the TVs, taking liquor and other items in the suites, and vandalising some suites, just after midnight on Friday. Their raid took less than an hour and they packed the goods into three vehicles then left. It is the third time since 2015 that the stadium has been hit by robbers. This time, however, the men and a woman were armed, said a senior official of the Western Province Cricket Association (WPCA). The glass doors of about 25 suites were smashed. It all started when a woman approached security officials at Gate A and asked  directions to a church in the area. “When she returned five minutes later to ask a similar question, three men jumped the security fences and were soon joined by more than 15 men,” said a senior official of WPCA “Some had guns and forced the security officials to give them the keys to the President’s Suite. “The SAPS are busy with an extensive investigation into the event and we will also reassess our security measures, including the possibility of having more cameras installed,” he said. Newlands recently hosted the third Test against Australia and South Africa – spearheaded by Morne Morkel who captured 5-23 – won the Test in emphatic fashion by 322 runs. “As an association we are deeply disturbed by the robbery and will do our utmost with the help of the SAPS to get to the bottom of this and try to prevent a recurrence of this type of incident. “We will seriously look within our budgetary constraints to improve our security situation at the stadium,” said the senior official of the WPCA. “While it is truly appalling for this type of robbery to take place at our well-loved  cricket stadium, where we have enjoyed some wonderful memories this past season, we are very thankful that the security guard caught up in this crime was unharmed. “He has been offered the necessary counselling in  order to help him recover  from this ordeal,” the official said.
