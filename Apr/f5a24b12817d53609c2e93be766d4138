They were demanding that they be granted permits or the amendment of the legislation dealing with the selling of liquor. The traders claimed harassment from the police and the liquor laws were forcing many of them to shut down. Unlicensed trader Lungelo Tshoba said: “I feed four young children, finance two of my children at university and feeding the whole family. “Twice in a month the police come and take everything.” Vuma Liquor Traders Association executive committee member Maha Ndumela said the occupation of the offices was to send a message to the board that they would not tolerate harassment. “If this harassment continues and our businesses continue to be closed, we are going to fight for our rights as this is the language our government understands,” he said. He said the board needed to arrange a meeting with the association, as well as the Western Cape Liquor Traders Association, to resolve their differences. Western Cape Liquor Board deputy director Martell van Lille said: “We don’t have any control over the amendments of the regulations, the provincial government does. “We want to provide licences to the traders in order to regulate effectively.” Van Lille said he would request a meeting between the City, the board and the traders.
