The City yesterday warned commuters to prepare for further disruption to its MyCiTi service, as it remains suspended. This comes after talks between the unions and employers with the bargaining council collapsed last week, resulting in further action to intensify the strike by seeking non-striking workers to join to force the employers' hand The unions representing thousands of employees rejected the employers’ new wage offer of an 8.5% increase and 9% increase at the weekend. Mayco member for transport and urban development Brett Heron said: “Those making use of road-based transport should expect heavy traffic and longer travelling times for as long as the strike continues, in particular at the start of a new work week. "The lockout instituted by the vehicle operating companies operating the MyCiTi service will thus remain in place until further notice. "Regretfully, this means that there will be no MyCiTi trunk or feeder services available for as long as the strike and lockout continue. ” South African Transport and Allied Workers Union spokesperson Zanele Sabela said the talks did not go as hoped. “We lowered our demands from 12% across the board wage increase to 9.5% for the first year and 9% for the second year. "Meanwhile, employers put on the table the CCMA mediator’s proposal from even before a strike certificate was issued - 8.5% increase across the board for year one and 8% for year two. "We are just a percentage apart but the sticking points are the dual driver issue, night shift and the insourcing of workers such as cleaners - who are provided for in the bargaining council agreement.”
