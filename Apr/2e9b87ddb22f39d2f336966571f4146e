It said this will increase segregation and the marginalisation of the poor. At the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) eighth Global Private Education Conference in the city, about 100 Sadtu and Cosatu-
affiliated called for an end to the privatisation of schools in southern Africa. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and is focused on the private sector in emerging markets, and the conference is aimed at bringing together executives and investors in emerging market private education, to share insight on the latest developments, and to build bridges between private education institutions and investors. According to the IFC's website, most participants are C-Suite executives, including some of the world's most recognised global private education chief executives. Sadtu said the IFC and the World Bank supported the Bridge International Academies which, according to its website, uses “innovation and technology” to transform learning, and its school are data driven and evidence-based. Sadtu said the academies were predatory “low-fee” private schools that sought to make education a commodity, and with the aim to destabilise public education. “Bridge International Academies efforts in Global South are a serious threat to democracy and will ultimately increase segregation and marginalisation. Access to education is a fundamental human right and should not be based on a family's ability to pay. "By supporting the expansion of low-fee private schooling and other competitive practices, IFC and the World Bank are essentially ensuring that a large number of the world’s most vulnerable children have no hope of receiving free, quality public education.” An IFC spokesperson said unmet needs for education required new funding from public and private sources for training teachers, building infrastructure and developing curricula.
