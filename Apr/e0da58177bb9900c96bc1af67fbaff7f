This is according to Bernickow’s widow, Lorna Daniels, who will accept the award on behalf of her late husband. She will be accompanied by her two sons and daughter at the awards ceremony on April 28. Bernickow, the former Western Cape head of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), has been posthumously honoured with the National Order of Luthuli in bronze. National Orders are the highest awards bestowed on citizens and eminent foreign nationals who contributed to the advancement of democracy and made a significant impact on improving the lives of South Africans. The Order of Luthuli recognises SA citizens who have contributed to the Struggle for democracy, nation-building, building democracy and human rights, justice and peace as well as resolution of conflict. Daniels said Bernickow became involved in the anti-apartheid struggle at the age of 16 and his life represented the values and principles needed for the new South Africa. “Many lives were lost and many lives broken. But more so, today, the symbolism of this award is a powerful reminder of the huge task still ahead of us to build a society that is free from poverty, united and equal. “This award is also a reminder of the values, principles, the courage and commitment which must anchor South Africa as we continuously strive to shape our country,” she said. Bernickow started work as a messenger at the Cape Argus and became the first organiser of the Media Workers Association of South Africa (Mwasa), followed by his work for the CCMA.
