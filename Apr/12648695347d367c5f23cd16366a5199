Johannesburg - A documentary exposing a massive operation by the apartheid government to discredit and isolate Winnie Madikizela-Mandela left South Africans seething and weeping on Wednesday night. For the first time South Africans were able to view Pascale Lamche’s award-winning documentary Winnie, which exposes the extent of the apartheid regime’s plan to neutralise her as a political force. It also revealed details about the Stompie Seipei saga, how Chris Hani's death affected Madikizela-Mandela and that former president Nelson Mandela had been made to choose between his wife and the presidency.
