A 56-year-old man was stabbed while hiking with his partner yesterday. The incident comes less than three weeks after nine hikers were attacked and robbed of their possessions while hiking St James Peak earlier this month. That incident led to the deployment of additional resources on the mountain side above Kalk Bay. Yesterday, police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a murder case had 
been opened for investigation following an incident that occurred in Echo Valley, opposite Boyes Drive in St James, Muizenberg. “According to information, a 56-year-old man was stabbed while hiking with his wife by a suspect who was wearing a security uniform. “The victim died due to his injuries. No one has been arrested so far.” Hikers Network president Anwaaz Bent said: “We are concerned about the recent spike in attacks on the mountains. "I came to learn about this just after it happened. "It is really disturbing that people are not safe out there any more. “There is not a particular hot spot. “These guys just go out anywhere they see they can attack hikers.”
