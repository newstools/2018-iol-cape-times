Vigilant police members of the Crime Intelligence office were patrolling the area when they observed a blue BMW X5 parked in front of a "well-known" drug haunt in Keith Road.  A  man, who was making his way to the vehicle, saw SAPS members and turned back towards the residence.  Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said they followed the suspect and nabbed him before he could close the security gate and door of the property.  Van Wyk said upon searching a rubbish bin in which the police had seen the man throw something, they found a large amount of cash in cling-wrapping.  A  further search revealed more cash which was found inside the stove and the fridge at the property. “The suspect was brought in for questioning, and the undisclosed amount of cash was confiscated and handed over to the National Prosecuting Authority's Asset Forfeiture Unit.  An inquiry will be opened and investigated by the Grassy Park SAPS.  “The cash is suspected to be the proceeds of drug dealing, and it is believed the suspect was on his way to pay the cash to the driver of the blue BMW,” said Van Wyk.  The Grassy Park police acting station commander, Christian Esau, who was part of the confiscation, praised the police involved in the operation.  “Anyone with information on crime in the Grassy Park area is urged to call 021 700 3940 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111. All information will be treated as highly confidential,” said Van Wyk. Meanwhile, in a house on Station Road in Observatory, police confiscated 18 laptops and various cellphones that were hidden in one of the cupboards.  Three suspects were arrested for the possession of dagga and possibly stolen property. “A preliminary investigation revealed that a fourth man, who was also at the house, was wanted for a robbery committed in Observatory a couple of weeks ago, and he was subsequently arrested.”   lonwabo.marele@inl.co.za
