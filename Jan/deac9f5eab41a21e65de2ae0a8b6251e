Parliament on Wednesday said that it would hold a dialogue to engage and empower key stakeholders, the media and the public on the institution's revised and updated rules in Gauteng next week. Parliament said it has prioritised the engagement of the media, opinion-makers, commentators on governance and civil society organisations to enhance the awareness and understanding of its rules. This year's dialogue, which is a sequel to the ones held in Parliament last year, will be addressed by the secretaries to the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces. It will give a clear perspective of the rules of both houses of Parliament, including the Joint Rules. Reviews of the rules of Parliament are periodically undertaken to ensure the decorum of the institution, and respond to challenges and gaps identified as the parliamentary democratic system of the country continues to grow and mature. Parliament is currently finalising the drafting of the rules to give effect to section 89 of the constitution, which deals with the impeachment of a president from office and is expected to be completed by the end of March. Parliament's public dialogue would be held on Monday at the Southern Sun OR Tambo International Airport in Ekurhuleni. African News Agency (ANA)
