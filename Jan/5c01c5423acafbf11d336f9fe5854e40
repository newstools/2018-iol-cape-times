Police say an intelligence operation led officers to an address in Bombay Street, where they discovered an illegal makeshift factory for ammunition. Large quantities of cartridges, projectiles and gunpowder were seized, as well as apparatus to manufacture ammunition. “We believe it is intended for the gangs in the Hanover Park area,” said police spokesperson Andre Traut. No one had been arrested. “Crimes associated with gangs will remain a priority for the SAPS in this province and we will pursue every avenue to bring perpetrators to book. “The circumstances surrounding the seizure are under investigation and the possibility of arrests is not ruled out. "The Western Cape police commissioner, Lieutenant-
General KE Jula, expressed his appreciation towards the members involved in the operation and said time was running out for criminals in the province.” Meanwhile, a Mitchells Plain woman was arrested with three illegal guns in Lentegeur on 
Saturday. “Police in Lentegeur reacted on a tip-off and searched a residence in Varing Street, where three firearms, comprising a 9mm pistol with a serial number, a .22 revolver reported stolen in Caledon and a .45 pistol with no serial number, were confiscated.” Two days before, the woman's son was also found in possession of an unlicensed firearm. Both suspects were due to make a court appearance in Mitchells Plain today.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
