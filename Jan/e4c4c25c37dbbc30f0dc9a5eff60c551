Qunu - ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa has reiterated his undertaking that his party will "deal" with those stealing taxpayers' money. Ramaphosa continued on his unity missions, telling the party supporters in Qunu, former President Nelson Mandela's home, that they were "renewing and repositioning to be attractive to people again." Speaking in a mixture of English and IsiXhosa at the Qunu community hall, Ramaphosa also laid down the law, saying the ANC had to stop fighting among themselves.    "The one thing that we must do is to be united. We were elected to unite the ANC. This thing of us fighting among ourselves must end," he said. "When we speak we must speak in one voice," he added. Earlier Ramaphosa led the ANC officials on a visit to Mandela's residence.    He told the audience that they would restore the values and principles of Mandela in running the party. Ramaphosa is under pressure to deal with corruption in the party ranks as this was his central message during his party presidential campaign.Â  He had on numerous occasions on the campaign trail called for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into state capture. Hours before the meeting of the national executive committee on Wednesday, President Jacob Zuma announced the establishment of the commission to be headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo.
