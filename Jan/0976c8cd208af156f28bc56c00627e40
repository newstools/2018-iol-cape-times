Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a preliminary investigation revealed that the suspects had been involved in an ATM  incident in Strand. “Alert community members in the Elsies River area, working closely with the police, informed them about a suspicious vehicle they observed in the neighbourhood. "Police followed up and the vehicle was spotted and searched. In the process, police confiscated an undisclosed amount of money,” she said. On Saturday, Rwexana said, while they were participating in efforts to address contact crimes in the province, “Nyanga police ensured that two suspects, aged 53 and 20 years, will appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on Monday" (today). Rwexana said one suspect is facing a charge of murder and the other a charge of rape. She said the suspects were arrested on Thursday in Samora Machel and Sweet Home Farms. “The 53-year-old man had allegedly sexually assaulted his daughter while her mother was busy in the house. The suspect told the victim not to tell her mother, but the girl ultimately informed someone close to her. “The 20-year-old suspect was arrested for allegedly stabbing a 23-yea-r old man during December in Sweet Home Farms. The victim died later in hospital,” Rwexana said.
