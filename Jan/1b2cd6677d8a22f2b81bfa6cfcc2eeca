According to Tammy de Decker, the strategic co-ordinator for Economic Opportunities MEC, Alan Winde, while there had been no new cases at uninfected farms, in December there was a recurrence at a previously infected farm.  Winde has urged poultry owners to remain vigilant and to maintain strict biosecurity measures. There are 68 confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the Western Cape. In November, the department said infections in the Western Cape had come to a halt, with no new confirmed cases.  Despite critically endangered birds dying at Africa’s largest bird park due to the avian influenza outbreak, World Of Birds owners are optimistic they can beat the virus.   World of Birds is home to more than 3000 species, including South Africa's national bird, the Blue Crane. The facility is under quarantine, but is still open for business as the highly HPAI virus cannot be passed on to humans. Manager and co-owner Hendrik Louw said: “Just this morning we were in contact with the state vet and we are working towards the quarantine status being lifted.”  If after 42 days since the first disinfection, the state veterinarian is satisfied that the property is free from HPAI, the quarantine may be lifted.  “We have had no new cases since about two months ago. Everything seems to be going well," Louw said.  "This is great news, but the outbreak has taken its toll."  According to Louw, visitors sometimes came to the facility and left when they saw signage warning that the park was under quarantine, despite the flu not being harmful to humans.  He said that despite the usual festive season boom of visitors, the park had not seen the same numbers as previous years.  As a result of the influenza outbreak, the price of 18 eggs climbed from R38.42 in September last year, to R42.66 in October.  Culling has been so widespread, early estimates project R800million in immediate production losses to the poultry industry.   lisa.isaacs@inl.co.za
