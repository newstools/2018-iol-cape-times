A crash 15 kilometres from Worcester involving a light motor vehicle and a bakkie, in which four people died and nine were injured was the latest incident. The injured were taken to Worcester Hospital. In previous years the N1 
highway between Laingsburg and Beaufort West had been identified as the province's worst accident hot spot, but the Western Cape provincial traffic department has now identified the stretch between Paarl and Worcester as a new hot spot. Senior manager Farrel Payne said the high 
volume of traffic on the road over the festive season was unexpected. “The Western Cape traffic department had expected traffic volumes to Cape Town to be lower this past holiday season because of the water 
restrictions and increased price of petrol,” Payne said. Negligence An analysis of road traffic volumes on the N1 has helped traffic authorities take steps to curb the problem. The use of unmarked traffic vehicles to patrol the hot spot has been implemented, as has alcohol breath-testing and the checking of valid drivers' licences. This is the method 
previously used to curb fatal crashes on the road between Laingsburg and Beaufort West. Payne cited negligence on the part of drivers as one of the main contributors to fatal road crashes.  “Drivers need to ensure that they are well rested before taking to the roads. Fatigued drivers cannot concentrate and that is what causes accidents.”  Western Cape traffic provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa urged motorists to respect the rules of the road.  "It is like we as traffic officers have to babysit adults on the roads. Be mindful of other 
drivers and stay vigilant,” Africa advised all drivers. Cape Argus
