The period calculated was from December 1, 2017 to January 24, 2018. Bosman said that their officials did a week-on-week assessment and compared 
the numbers to the previous year. “This allowed us to see there was a considerable decrease in bush and grass fires over the festive period. “February was usually the hottest summer month and this season was expected to be one of the worst due to hot, dry and windy conditions,” he said. Bosman said the City’s fire department had to battle the current water crisis by storing water with the use of large water tanks. “The firefighters refer to these tanks as bunkers, with each bunker able to hold up to 1000 litres of water or more. “We have also been contacted by citizens who wish to donate their pool water and we have sent out our tanks and collected from pools up to 20 litres and more,” he said. The water collected is used to refill the water tanks, said Bosman. According to officials, there were 9 000 wildfires reported in the Western Cape between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017. The province’s response plans were designed around responding rapidly to a wildfire in its early stages. Critical partners in the Western Cape wildfire programme include NGO Working on Fire, the City of Cape Town’s Fire Service, district municipality fire services, SANParks, CapeNature and volunteer firefighters.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
