East London-based borehole digging company AB Pumps was awarded a tender by the Drakenstein Municipality in Paarl to drill and test water. A 41-year-old worker, who asked that his name be withheld, said he was one of 30 workers involved in the Paarl project. “We arrived on January 7 and we spoke to the owner, Mr Van der Walt, about our working conditions and our overtime. He told us that we work every day and anyone who was unhappy can leave and received letters telling us we are dismissed,” said the worker. He said that all 30 workers had been living in an old "shed" on a farm, with one toilet, since they arrived but the farm owner now plans to evict them this weekend. The workers’ allegations against the company include under payment of skilled labourers, non-payment of rest and recovery leave and hazardous working conditions, including being forced to sample the extracted water to check if the water does not have pathogens. EFF ward councillor Thembile Klaas said the workers came to the party for help and they have reported the 
matter to the Labour Department and would next approach 
the Human Rights Commission as the workers must be assisted. Labour Department provincial inspectorate head David Esau said they, along with municipal officials, visited the workers, but there were certain technical matters that needed to be looked at with regards to the company and confirmation of which sector it falls under, which would be addressed once they had met with the employer. Johan van der Walt referred the Cape Times to his legal adviser, Johan van Loggerenberg, who said they would not comment as the matter was a labour-related dispute and any his client would take legal action against any reports “slandering” his name.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
