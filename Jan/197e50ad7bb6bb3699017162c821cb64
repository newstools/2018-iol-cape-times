Members of a street committee in the Manenberg bus terminus were outraged after contractors damaged their food garden, saying  they were not informed about the City’s development plans. The construction of pavements is part of the City’s roads and stormwater department’s plan to improve pedestrian safety in the vicinity of the terminus. The community had planned to develop the space around the bus terminus into a community market that would include a stage for cultural activities, the erection of stalls, a play park and a food garden. Following a meeting with the ward councillor, an “amicable solution” was reached. All parties agreed the contractor would fix the damage to the garden and continue construction without disturbing it. Street Committee spokesperson Mario Wanza said: “We are happy because we are breaking the culture where decisions about us are made for us. Government is listening. This outcome was very positive. “There is a breakdown between the community and government about the roles each party plays in the community’s development. We must work together,” he said. Wanza added they would continue gardening and have been advised to submit a needs list for their development plan. “We will now meet with the City to learn how to unlock money allocated for development in the area, so we can be a part of our own development,” he said. Wanza said their vision was to restore Manenberg from colonial culture back to indigenous by getting the people in touch with nature. Ward 42 councillor Sonwabo Ngxumza said the problem could have been resolved sooner if the contractor had alerted him. “I was only alerted by community leaders. I was out of Cape Town and that’s why I only managed to intervene this week,” said Ngxumza. “It is good that they are taking the initiative and I support any project that will uplift the people.”
