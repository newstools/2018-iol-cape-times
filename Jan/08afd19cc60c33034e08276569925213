Xakeka, 23, is believed to have been harassed, called names and assaulted before she was stabbed last week after an argument with her attacker. She later died in hospital. Her family said she was attacked because of her sexual orientation. Outraged LGBTI rights organisations said attacks on lesbians not only in Strand, but other townships, should come to an end. Funeka Soldaat of Free Gender said in order for communities to stop stigmatising lesbians and gays, community organisations should invite LGBTI organisations to their meetings, religious gatherings and political rallies to talk about being lesbian or gay. Soldaat encouraged people living as lesbians to “come out of the closet” and live openly. Triangle Project member Sindiswa Tafeni said the LGBTI community felt excluded, as there was no mention of them during the commemoration of 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children Abuse. “We need community engagement and for parents to understand that these are their children,” said Tafeni.  Xakeka’s girlfriend, Babalwa Mkhosi, said she was heartbroken at having lost her partner in such circumstances, “but I will remember all the good times I had with her”.  Mkhosi said Xakeka was a “very emotional person, kind and loving. Her family must be strong, as much as we know it is hard and it will continue to be hard”, she said. Akhona Mbele, a friend of Xakeka’s, recited a poem while pictures of Xakeka were hung on the wall of the Nomzamo community hall. Xakeka’s cousin Nokuthula Ntlazana, said even though the LGBTI community had assisted in making the memorial service possible, “there remains a dire need for more assistance. “Noxolo was the breadwinner and her father had piece jobs, but he is now not fit to work,” said Ntlazana.
