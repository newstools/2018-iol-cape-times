The eight-year-old from Mitchells Plain inspired Capetonians as he struggled with stage four neuroblastoma, with which he was diagnosed in 2014.  The little fighter defied doctors’ prognosis right up until he passed away on New Year’s Day in Red Cross Children’s Hospital. Junaid even earned a special place in the hearts of Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu and Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille. The two have pledged money to contribute to Junaid’s funeral .

The service will commence at 8.30am at Orion Church International in Rocklands, Mitchells Plain.  He will be buried at Klip Road Cemetery at 11.30am.
