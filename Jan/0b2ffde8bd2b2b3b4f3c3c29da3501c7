However, that’s if he can raise his travel and accommodation expenses to Germany. The gifted Qden is among 10 child pianists from around the world invited for master classes under the dean of the University of Music and Performing Arts Mannheim in Germany, Professor Rudolf Meister, and Professor Wolfram Schmidt-Leonardy. Besides the concerto, proceeds of which will go to Unicef project Schools for Africa, Qden will perform three other concerts from March 23 to 30 during his stay in Saarlouis, Germany. Qden’s expenses for his musical journey to Germany will amount to about R50 000, according to his father, Denrick Blaauw. “So far we have raised R1800 on our crowdfunding website. He can’t go alone, because of being underage, so a parent will accompany him. “Fees we are paying for his tuition are high, but we would not want him to miss any opportunities that come his way,” said Blaauw. “Obviously we are very proud and excited for the upcoming events in Germany. He is the first from Africa to be selected.” Qden reportedly started playing piano five years ago, showing an interest in classical music from an early age.
