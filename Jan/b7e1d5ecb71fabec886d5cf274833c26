Patterson, 38, who has already climbed every day since the beginning of the year, said the initiative was aimed at assisting a million South Africans “who through no fault of their own started on the back foot of life”. “Instead of returning to corporate life, I decided some time ago to focus on honouring my idea, which I treated like a business, training both my body and my mind simultaneously,” he said. Via the 67 Minutes for Nelson Mandela and various voluntary programmes in the past, he built a relationship with the three 
charities. They are Habitat for Humanity in Pinelands, One Heart For Kids in Stellenbosch and the Sunflower Fund in Claremont. “Habitat for Humanity is an organisation I got my previous company involved with after 
Nelson Mandela passed away, where we hoped to build two homes a month for the less fortunate. “I met Lisa Thompson-Smeddle, the founder of One Heart For Kids, the day after I had my idea and she had so many ideas and was so supportive. “I've worked with the Sunflower Fund in the past, raising money during Argus season for the past five years,“ Patterson said. In 2015, Habitat for Humanity was highly praised by Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. To donate R1 or more to this charitable cause, visit Backabuddy: https://www.backabuddy.co.za/365-ubuntuclimbs
