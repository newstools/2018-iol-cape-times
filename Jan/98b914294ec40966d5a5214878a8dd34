Deputy mayor Ian Neilson disclosed the cost involved at a media briefing at the Disaster Risk Management Centre in Goodwood yesterday, where the City introduced its “Disaster Water Plan”. The 200 water collection points will be introduced across the CBD once the dam levels reach 13.5%. Neilson was joined by Mayco member for informal settlements, water and waste services Xanthea Limberg; Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith; safety and security executive director Richard Bosman; and head of disaster risk management Greg Pillay. He said the City would shut down its reticulation system (pipe network), except to key commercial areas and institutions such as hospitals, on Day Zero. “Once this happens, residents will be able to access water from collection points across the City. Each resident will be allocated 25 litres of water a day. “This would cost about R200m and would come straight from the City’s budget,” he added. Neilson said although the National Department of Water and Sanitation was responsible for bulk water, it had done very little to assist with the drought crisis. Only R20m had been provided, on condition that it be utilised for underground water resources, said Nielson. He added that this was not sustainable. He also announced that plans would be communicated over the department’s suggested desalination plant that required clarification. Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane visited Cape Town at the weekend.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
