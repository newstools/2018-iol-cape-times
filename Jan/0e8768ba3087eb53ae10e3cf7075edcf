Junaid, 8, had not been doing well in the last few months and was no longer responding to treatment and medication at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. He could digest nothing but liquids and was looking tired and pale, his face and body swollen from the medicine that no longer had any effect on his condition. In May 2014, Junaid was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma - a solid cancerous tumour that begins in the nerve cells of infants and young children. In June 2015, doctors gave him just three months to live but he soldiered on until yesterday. Messages of support poured in, wishing Junaid’s family strength in this difficult time, with Sheril Joseph-Borgches writing on Facebook, “our deepest sympathy”. Mayor Patricia de Lille said Junaid’s family informed her of his death. She described Junaid as a fighter and vibrant. “Besides what the doctors had done, and we must commend their efforts, that little boy is a fighter, he defied all odds,” said De Lille. She said the last time she saw him “he was so weak (and) there was nothing doctors could do for him. He was suffering a great deal." De Lille said she was planning to visit Junaid today but received the news of his death yesterday. Like she always does, De Lille was going to bring him his favourite meal, a chicken.  “He always asked me to bring him a chicken. He liked playing with my phone. He was always smiling despite the pain he suffered,” she said, adding she would consult with Junaid’s family to see how she could help with funeral arrangements. Junaid touched the hearts of many people, including Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, who helped renovate Junaid’s family home.  A month before the house was renovated, Sisulu visited him and brought him gifts and toys. Sisulu’s personal assistant referred queries to her spokesperson, who did not answer his phone. Cape Times
