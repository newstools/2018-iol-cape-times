Hawks spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha said Nwosu was arrested in Milnerton last Thursday. A multidisciplinary team consisting of members of the Hawks Anti-human trafficking, K9 and local police had followed up on information regarding an apparent human trafficking case. The raid resulted in two female victims, both aged 22, being freed and taken to a place of safety.  The victims had been allegedly forced to work as sex workers after they were reportedly lured, from Mpumalanga and Free State respectively in 2017, with offers of employment.   “Investigations continue,” Ramovha said.
