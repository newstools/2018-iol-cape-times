Mbizo Nonceba, 26, was alerted to an “accident” involving his son, Inganathi Dywili. He rushed to the scene, where he found Inganathi lying on the ground with burns on his abdomen, hands and knees. Inganathi was electrocuted when he stepped on a metal sheet attached to an illegally connected live wire. He was rushed to hospital, where he was declared dead shortly after he arrived on Thursday. Nonceba said it was believed Inganathi was playing in the alleys between shacks when he stood on the metal zinc, which had an illegally connected wire crossing over it. When Inganathi collapsed, his friends called for help, said Nonceba. Inganathi’s mother, Nonzwakazi Dywili, could not speak as she grappled with the loss of her son. Community leader Mzwamadoda Fojisa said that in recent months, illegal electricity connections had electrocuted three other people. “The people understand the dangers of illegal connections, but they have no choice because life would be difficult for them without electricity.” Police spokesperson Andre Traut said an inquest docket had been opened.
