Many took to social media to send their condolences and memories of Morkel, including former DA leader Tony Leon. "Sorry to learn of death today of former Premier and Cape Town Mayor Gerald Morkel. In 2001 and after when Democratic Alliance was in the fight of its life against NNP defectors, he was the real frontline soldier in its survival.  "His defiant speech against the perfidious Marthinus van Schalkwyk still makes for riveting reading. Salute!" Leon said. Current mayor of Cape Town Patricia De Lille also posted her condolences. "It is with a great sense of sadness that we have learnt of the passing of our city’s stalwarts, Gerald Morkel.
