Cape Town - Police say the suspect who allegedly stabbed a hiker to death near Boyes Drive in St James on Sunday posed as a security guard. A 56-year-old man was stabbed while hiking with his partner on Sunday. The incident comes less than three weeks after nine hikers were attacked and robbed of their possessions while hiking St James Peak earlier this month. That incident led to the deployment of additional resources on the mountain side above Kalk Bay. On Sunday, police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a murder case had been opened for investigation following an incident that occurred in Echo Valley, opposite Boyes Drive in St James, Muizenberg.
