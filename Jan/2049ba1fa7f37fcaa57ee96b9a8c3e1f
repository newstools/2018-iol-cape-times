East London - The African National Congress wants to spread a new culture of "being on time", ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa told the party's 106th birthday celebrations at the Buffalo City Stadium in East London on Saturday. Addressing thousands of supporters, Ramaphosa said, "As you can see, this year we started on time. It's a clear signal that things are changing. The NEC [national executive committee] meeting also started on time. [Former president] Nelson Mandela would have been pleased... We want a new culture to spread. When we have a meeting, it should start on time." Punctuality had to be central to "meeting culture" in future. Earlier, Ramaphosa intervened in the booing of President Jacob Zuma by sections of the crowd in the stadium, saying "today [Saturday] it's a day of happiness, it's a day of rejoicing, and not a day of doing other things."Â  Read: Zuma booed at #ANC106 celebrations Ramaphosa also paid tribute to ANC stalwarts of the Eastern Cape.
