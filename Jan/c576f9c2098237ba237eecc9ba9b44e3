Orielle Berry said she had received two fines totalling R1100 after the City had incorrectly captured two offending vehicles’ car registration numbers and linked them to her ID number. Berry said she had called the City’s traffic services and was told she needed to go to a police station to sign an affidavit stating that she did not own the cars. City traffic spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout said the error was introduced after Berry had hired a white Toyota Avanza 1.5 SX from a rental company last year. The registration number of that vehicle had also previously been registered to a white Toyota HiAce minibus. However, the owner failed to change the physical plates when he was issued with a new registration number. “The system extracted (the rental company’s) information and the traffic ticket number was sent to them in error. (The rental company) then submitted Ms Berry’s details as being the driver at the time.” Berry’s fines had been withdrawn, Bezuidenhout said.
