Gavin Joe, 38, pleaded guilty to a charge of crimen injuria for injuring and insulting the dignity of Maggie Marx, 30, the mother of a now 14-month old boy. On June 13 last year while Joe, an IT trainer, was facilitating training at UCTâ€™s middle campus, he admitted to placing his cellphone in a cereal box and cutting holes in the box. He placed the only chair in the room so that the person sitting there would be in full view of his concealed camera. He programmed the phone to send the recording to his PC. Joe said he had seen Marx undo her shirt and attach the breast pump to her breasts. When Marx realised she was being recorded, she immediately contacted the office administrator. Joe received a 12-month prison sentence, which would be suspended for three years on condition that he pay a R10 000 fine. He must also donate R4000 to non-profit organisation Milk Matters by February 15. He also has to render 120 hours of community service and attend therapy sessions for two years. He will have to pay for these himself. Joe lost his job after the incident.  nicola.daniels@inl.co.za
