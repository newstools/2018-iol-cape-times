A groundwater survey commissioned by the City of Cape Town had found aquifers can deliver more water than initially anticipated, Mayor Patricia de Lille said on Tuesday. "Today we announce our news that we can get 150 million (litres of) water per day," De Lille said at the Civic Centre. According to De Lille, prime locations for drilling had been identified and major drilling companies around the country had been mobilised.  Towards the end of the week, she would take media on a tour to the Cape Flats aquifer to show where the drilling will take place "We have a plan on how we will replenish, put water back into the aquifer after taking water out of it," she said. "We need to use more money to pay for these projects and to do this we have introduced the drought charge and received 45 000 comments from the public." De Lille said there seemed to be a lack of proper information to the public and reiterated that not everyone will be affected by the drought charges, but only 464 216 households out of a total of over 700 000.  Of these, only 52 510 households will pay more than R150 a month in drought levy, while the majority of households will pay less than R47 per month.  "We remain committed to lesson the burden on residents and to make sure they receive quality basic services," she said. De Lille added that at current projections, Day Zero, which is when the city runs out of potable water, will be on April 22. African News Agency/ANA
