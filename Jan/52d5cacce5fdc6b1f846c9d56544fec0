Western Cape Missing Persons Unit chairperson Candice Sobotker said an extensive search was conducted after the father “kidnapped” the child on Monday. “We were informed of the child who was taken by his biological father on Monday. We went to report the case at Delft SAPS immediately, but when we got there they did not want to take the case, and said the mother must go look at an address where the father could possibly be. “On Tuesday morning, the mother was told the child was in Red Cross Hospital after he was found near a drain and looked as if he was choked. According to information, the father said he was going to kill the child when the mother confronted him about the child.” She said they are infuriated by the lack of service from the Delft SAPS. “The child was found with bruises on his body and was taken to Red Cross Children's Hospital after being referred from Tygerberg Hospital. "After the child was found, we went to the police station again and only then did they assisted in opening a case of attempted murder. "This could have been avoided if something was done at the same time as the mother reported the matter,” she said. “How do our kids know who to trust when they can't even trust their own parents. "This is so sad. The laws have changed so much - all in favour of the criminals. Where do we go from here?” Approached for comment, police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that the case was currently being fully investigated by the SAPS in Delft. “According to our information, on January 15 a 33-year-old man assaulted a baby. Circumstances surrounding this incident are still under investigation." She said the suspect would appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court once charged.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
