Cape Town - Police have opened an investigation after multiple muggings and stabbings occurred in the mountains above Kalk Bay. Shortly after 9am on Saturday, Wilderness Search and Rescue were called to help four hikers who were stabbed and robbed of their possessions while hiking St James Peak. A further nine people were attacked between 11am-12pm at the Silvermine Gate 2. Police and private security companies then launched a search for the assailants in the area. The victims sustained moderate to serious stab wounds. Four hikers were treated on site by Wilderness Search and Rescue; five others - one who was seriously injured - were evacuated in a SkyMed helicopter. The hikers were taken to the Groote Schuur, False Bay and Vincent Pallotti hospitals. SAPS spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of robbery with a weapon had been opened. “According to information at hand, the victims were approached by two suspects, one of whom had a knife in his possession,” she said. Adding that no one has been arrested yet, she urged the public not to approach the suspects as they were armed and dangerous. Wilderness Search and Rescue spokesperson Johan Marais said that the assailants had masqueraded as hikers. “Two men approached them looking like hikers and they started to walk with them for about 30 minutes before they suddenly turned on them and stabbed some of the people. “We found two separate groups of hikers then and we think that the reason they split up was because they tried to defend themselves or it could be two separate stabbings,” said Marais. He added that all the hikers had given good descriptions of the assailants to the police. Weekend Argus
