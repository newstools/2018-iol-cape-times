Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the eight suspects, who posed as police officers, used blue lights and a siren fitted on a white Ford Focus car to pull the truck from the road on Thursday. The empty truck was later discovered abandoned in Macassar. “Thorough investigations by members of the Hijacking Team and Mitchells Plain detectives led them to an address in Mitchells Plain where the first suspect, a 32-year-old man, was arrested this morning (Sunday). “He was found in possession of a Ford Focus fitted with a siren, loudspeaker and blue light. “Inside the vehicle, police found an SAPS-issue beanie and a Traffic Services reflective jacket. This arrest resulted in three more suspects, aged between 28 and 33, being arrested in Silversands.” Traut said circumstances surrounding the case were under investigation and the possibility of more arrests had not been ruled out. The cargo was yet to be retrieved. The suspects are due to make a court appearance in Mitchells Plain once they have been charged. Western Cape police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula said serious and violent crimes were in their sights, and police would not rest 
until the offenders had been apprehended.
