Cape Town - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) and the United National Transport Union, which represents many Metrorail train drivers and staff, were set to hold a two-day workshop to discuss the future of Metrorail's Central Line in Cape Town. The line has been under siege by vandals who have forced its closure this week. The Bonteheuwel substation was vandalised prolonging the suspension of services along the Central Line.

Also read: Metrorail Central line along the Cape Flats closed until Wednesday "The talks relate to the closure of the Central Line on Wednesday, the 10th of January 2018 following an incident in Khayelitsha of the fatal shooting of a security guard at the station at the Khayelitsha Station. "The talks will, once concluded, ensure the restoration of the Central Line service on the targeted date of the 17th January 2018. Both PRASA and UNTU are sensitive to the impact of the current termination of service in the Central Area on commuters who rely on the service. "PRASA and UNTU are also experiencing the negative impact of crime against the employees and members of UNTU as results of criminal attacks and the lack of respect for the hard work and sacrifices made in delivering the service. "PRASA is appreciative of the willingness of UNTU to find a workable solution to return the service even in the face of rampant attacks against its asset and most importantly to its passengers and employees. "The talks will take place region-wide with assessments done in a multi-party approach over a two day workshop planned for 17th and 18th January 2018 in Cape Town," Prasa said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
