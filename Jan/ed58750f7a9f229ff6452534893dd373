Johannesburg - The ANC on Wednesday distanced itself from what it termed fake statements alleged to have been issued by secretary-general Ace Magashule regarding President Jacob Zuma's dismissal. This comes after posts emerged on social media reportedly issued following the party's National Working Committee (NWC) meeting that took place on January 29, 2018. In the statement, the NWC said it welcomed the "Top 6 swift action on the reckless and irresponsible statements made by the SG and deputy SG on the occasions of the celebrations of the 106th anniversary of the ANC". "The NWC re-emphasised the centrality of the SGO in our endeavours to renew and unite the movement in general [and] a commitment was made to ascertain that such conduct doesn't surface in the movement and all must act in unison henceforth. "NWC also noted the absence and apology of the former president on official duty to Ethiopia. Having discussed a set of actions that would place the ANC in good stead and enable us to best manage transition, NWC resolved that President Jacob Zuma must step down with immediate effect."

The committee went on to thank Zuma for his service and urged members to give Zuma the space and dignity and to act with restraint. The ruling in a statement said it had noted the so-called statements being shared on social media. "The ANC distances itself from these statements. All official communication from the ANC to the media is issued via the ANC Media List. "Any other correspondence not emanating from this platform should be viewed with circumspect and clarity in such instances should be sought from the comrades mandated to speak on behalf of the ANC."
