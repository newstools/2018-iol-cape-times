The Cape Flats, Table Mountain and Atlantis aquifers will together produce at least 150 million litres of water a day. As Day Zero - the day the City will be forced to turn off most taps - moved even closer, to April 22, De Lille said drilling at the Cape Flats aquifer would start this week.  The aquifer will deliver an extra 80 million litres of water a day, while the Table Mountain and Atlantis aquifers will deliver 40 million and 30 million litres, respectively. The City’s director for water and sanitation services, Peter Flower, said as the water from the aquifers were used, it would be replaced with treated water. Dam levels stand at an effective 19%. Despite an increased 
number of tourists visiting the city over the festive season, water consumption remained normal. Level 6 water restrictions are in effect and households that use more than 10.5 kilolitres a month will have a water management device fitted, at their cost. The City has also extended its comment period on the drought charge proposal to January 15. About 45 000 comments have been received. The drought charge was based on a property’s value and estimated at about 10% of the current municipal rates portion of a municipal account. To submit your comment, email: drought.charge@cape
