Sadtu noted that Education MEC Debbie Schäfer and department head Brian Schreuder were visiting Ireland and Finland until 
February 4. Union provincial secretary Jonavon Rustin yesterday discouraged the notion that schools should turn off their water supplies. He cited a number of reasons, including health and safety concerns, and to avoid the discontinuation of feeding schemes. Rustin said yesterday that a school in the Boland had already turned off its water and the children were no longer getting a hot meal. Some children rely on the meals they get at schools and the Boland school was now 
giving its pupils bread and jam instead, Rustin said. In Khayelitsha, at Uxolo High School, the taps have been turned off during classes. Principal Khaya Bonani said they were opened during breaks so pupils could have a sip of water. Today, Premier Helen Zille is expected to meet principals to discuss water issues. Rustin said it was disappointing that they had taken so long to do so. He said the union was invited to the meeting only on Monday, and felt the invitation was an “afterthought”. “The union is livid that the provincial government has taken so long to communicate with schools on the possibility of Day Zero,” Rustin said. Zille’s spokesperson, Michael Mpofu, had not responded to questions by deadline yesterday. Advocacy group Equal Education (EE) recently publicly slated Schäfer and Schreuder for being abroad while schools dealt with the water crisis, and said it was equally concerning they missed a three-day annual government education lekgotla hosted by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Schäfer’s spokesperson, Jessica Shelver, said the MEC and Schreuder were visiting Ireland and Finland, but were in “constant communication via various channels with officials that are responsible for drought and water management 
planning with schools”.  francesca.villette@inl.co.za
