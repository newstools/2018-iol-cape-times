But before the 21-year-old can tread the floorboards of the Applause Rising Talent Showcase in Orlando, Florida, where she has been invited to a singing audition in July, she has to raise funds to get there. Speaking during an interview at her mother Gertrude Brock’s modest flat in Zonnebloem, District Six, the shy Kristen said she had two earlier auditions, at GrandWest in 2016 and in Krugersdorp last October, to qualify. “The auditions resulted in me being invited by international talent scout Kim Myers to showcase my singing talents in the Applause Rising Talent Showcase from July 22 to 31 at the Walt Disney World Swan Hotel.” She and other aspiring 
singers, dancers, actors and models will be exposed to international agents, record labels, film casting directors, coaches and managers from New York, Los Angeles and Europe, she said.   Having never sung in 
public or in singing competitions before, Kirsten said: “Singing has always been my passion, but I always lacked the confidence to pursue it as a career. But I know that is what I’m destined to do.”  She said she and her mother had already started fund-raising for the R75 980 needed by March. Her mother, who paid for her registration fees and flights to the auditions, appealed for people and businesses to sponsor the cost of Kristen’s trip. “We’re optimistic and excited about the future and hope for someone to help 
Kristen make her dream of becoming a professional singer come true.” Potential sponsors can call Kristen at 073 752 7600 or her mother at 076 391 0107.   raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
