Western Cape Missing Persons Unit chairperson Candice Sobotker had rallied a team from various communities in a mass search in 
the CBD. One was found at Groote Schuur Hospital shortly after receiving a lead from police.  Sobotker said a mentally disabled boy was reunited with his family in Leiden, Delft, after he went missing 
on Tuesday.  “Keanu Mitchell was reported missing by his father. He was located in Hanover Park yesterday morning. His family was notified and he is safe and unharmed."  Sobotker said the unit received another lead from police for Charles Scheepers from Elsies River, who went missing on New Year’s Day.  “Scheepers was last seen by his cousin in Matroosfontein. He is an Alzheimer’s sufferer and was found roaming in the vicinity of the hospital.  “We suspect he might have found his way to the area because that is what is familiar to him. We are glad he was reunited with his family."   Sobotker said her 18-member team searched on foot in the CBD yesterday for other missing people.  “We have to cover all bases to be sure everything is done to find these missing people. We just want them to be reunited with their families again,” Sobotker said.  “We had flyers distributed on the Grand Parade today and because it was market day it meant more people would be out there. "Flyers were handed out all over the CBD today as we remained on the lookout for the missing people."  The search continues for 67-year-old Dhanaseelan Chellan, who was last seen in Crawford on January 2; Walter van Reenen, 72, who was last seen in Beacon Valley; and 67-year-old Saul Jacobs, who was last seen on New Year's Day in Belhar.  A search also continues for Robert Bailey, who was last seen on December 20 outside Oceana Fisheries on Beach Road in Strand. Bailey also suffers from Alzheimer’s.    chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
