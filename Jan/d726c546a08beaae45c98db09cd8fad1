It was held to honour 
and celebrate queer and feminist activists who have 
made strides in the film 
industry. Activist and event co-ordinator Mase Ramaru said the event was brought together from conceptualising it just over three weeks ago. “Our motivation was to create a space where people could have tough, uncomfortable conversations. It was also to remember and honour 
what the Queer movement was and where we are going,” she said. Response to the festival was overwhelmingly positive. Discussions would be held about making the event more virtual, and about hosting it with other regions, especially rural areas, she said. The event was hosted by LGBTI rights groups, The African Gender Institute, Triangle Project and Oxfam South Africa at the Bertha Movie House in Khayelitsha. The event included screenings of films around the topic of queer feminism, panel discussions that included veteran LGBTI rights activists, and performance art pieces, music and spoken word poetry. Co-creator and Oxfam SA project officer Xena Scullard said: “This event was used as a launchpad and the feminist films opened up spaces for learning and access to open dialogue on a variety of social issues. We are open to including community mechanisms and various role-players in a holistic approach in order to further expand its reach.” The prospect of using social media for live interaction with film-makers and activists 
during the festival was a concept under consideration, said Scullard. Triangle Project’s health and support services manager, Sharon Cox, said this would definitely not be the last festival following the “phenomenal feedback” and turnout over the two days.
