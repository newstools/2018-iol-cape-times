Cape Town - A Golden Arrow bus driver was injured when the bus he was driving was petrol bombed in Philippi during a service delivery protest on Monday. The protest led to the closure of Symphony Way and Stock Road, said City of Cape Town director for safety and security Richard Bosman. Golden Arrow’s Bronwen Dyke-Beyer confirmed that a bus, at a cost of R2.3 million was set alight and has subsequently burnt out. She said the driver sustained “light injuries”. Dyke-Beyer she was not able to confirm the extent of the injuries and whether there were passengers inside the bus. “We are extremely concerned about this act of vandalism and arson. A single stone throw on the bus might have fatal consequences. “And every bus that has been destroyed must be replaced. Because we are a private company the costs will be passed on to the passengers,” said Dyke-Beyer, and urged anyone with information to report it to the police. Bosman said there were about 200 people protesting. About 500 people from Philippi East, Brown’s Farm and Crossroads has been illegally occupying land along Govan Mbeki Road for the last three weeks, prompting law enforcement agencies to forcefully remove them.
