A man believed to be in his sixties drowned at Glen beach between Camps Bay and Maidens Cove on Thursday, paramedics said. ER24 spokesperson Ineke van Huyssteen said upon arriving on the scene paramedics found that lifeguards and Community Medics were performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the man, with Fire and Rescue Services also present. "ER24 immediately took over CPR and initiated advanced life support interventions. Unfortunately, the man stopped breathing shortly afterwards," van Huyssteen said. After several attempts to resuscitate, the man was declared dead on the scene. "The exact circumstances surrounding the incident were not yet known to our paramedics." Meanwhile, two people have been injured in separate incidents on Lion’s Head on Thursday, ER24 reported. In the first incident earlier on Thursday, a paraglider broke his ankle after he tried to stop during take-off and fell backwards onto the rocks.  Metro Rescue ALS, Mountain Rescue, and mountain rescuers from Table Mountain National Park stabilised the 29-year-old man before carrying him down to the bottom of the trail.  ER24 then assisted and transported the man to hospital for further medical care. In the other incident on Thursday afternoon, a 50-year-old man sustained moderate injuries after falling on Lion’s Head.  The man was stabilised on the mountain by Mountain Rescue before being airlifted by AMS to a nearby location, whereafter ER24 transported the man to New Somerset Hospital for further medical care.
