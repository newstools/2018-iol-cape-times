Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said since October last year, there had been an increase in these crimes reported in the province.  Most of the incidents were reported in the Blue Downs cluster, including Kuils River, Kleinvlei and Mfuleni. Van Wyk said there were also reports in Brackenfell, Stellenbosch, Macassar and Somerset West.  Van Wyk said the suspects would order taxis under false pretences and, when the driver arrived, they would ask to be driven to a certain point.  “On their way there, one of the suspects, who usually sat in the front of the vehicle with the driver, would point a gun at the driver and the one at the back would choke the victim at the same time. “Thereafter they would typically rob the driver of his cellphones and other valuables, pull him out of the vehicle and drive off with the vehicle.  “In some incidents the suspects ordered the driver to get into the boot of the car and, after robbing the victim, they would abandon the car and disappear with the victim’s belongings,” said Van Wyk.   Three suspects, aged between 21 and 29, were arrested and are due to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court today, he said.    Provincial police boss Khombinkosi Jula urged anyone who has more information, or who may have fallen victim to the perpetrators, to report similar incidents to the investigating officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Adrian Pretorius, on 082 777 8499.   lonwabo.marele@inl.co.za
