Johannesburg - Hugh Masekela’s trumpet fell silent today…forever. The beloved South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela died on Tuesday morning at the age of 78 surrounded by his family after losing his fight against prostate cancer. Tributes poured in from across the globe for the softly-spoken trumpeter, composer and singer whose career spanned several decades and who released over 40 albums. “What a loss, but what a life," said South African Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel from Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the World Economic Forum. "The word icon is overused but he truly was an icon of South African music and passion.” Masekela – fondly called “Bra Hugh” (Brother Hugh) by millions of of all races -- was born in Witbank, Mpumalanga - the eastern province bordering Swaziland and Mozambique. He is particularly well known for his jazz compositions which both mesmerised South Africans as well as delivered revolutionary messages during the bloody fight against the apartheid. "His music was a soundtrack to our fight for freedom as South Africans. I remember well how we sang 'Bring him back home' from the album 'Tomorrow' in the 1980s as we fought a defiant battle to have [former president] Nelson Mandela freed by the apartheid regime. Bra Hugh is a fighter, and I have no doubt he will survive this," said fan Tumisang Molepo. Masekela had been in treatment for prostate cancer since 2008. He is the father of American TV host, producer, singer, sport commentator, and actor Selema "Sal" Masekela.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
