Cape Town - Four people were injured on Tuesday when two trains collided at a depot in Ermelo in Mpumalanga, private emergency services provider ER24 reported. ER24 paramedics arrived at the depot and assessed the four patients and found that all four had sustained minor to moderate injuries. “Fortunately, no serious injuries or fatalities were found on the scene. The patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to Mediclinic Ermelo for further treatment,” said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring in a statement. It is understood the two trains collided at low speed inside the depot. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. This comes in a week after more than 200 people were injured following the collision of two Metrorail passenger trains at the Geldenhuys Station in Germiston. Prior to that, at least 19 people died and hundreds left injured when a passenger train crashed into a truck at a level crossing near Kroonstad in the Free State. African News Agency (ANA)
