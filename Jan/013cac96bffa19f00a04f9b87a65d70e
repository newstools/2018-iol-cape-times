Messages of condolences flooded social media since Sunday evening following the death of the Cape Town firefighter. Candice Kruger, also known as Ashley, was part of a three-
person team fighting the blaze on Table Mountain on Sunday afternoon. Kruger, 33, from Elsies River, was stationed at the City's Fire and Rescue Services department at the Roeland Street Fire Station. It is believed Kruger died due to cardiac arrest, but this can only be confirmed once the autopsy report has been completed. The City's Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson, Theo Layne, said the fire at Tafelberg Road was reported just after 11am and was extinguished by 4pm. “When they got to work up there, the conditions were hot, dry and windy. Four fire engines and three water tankers with 37 firefighters assisted on scene. “Kruger was part of this team and she collapsed shortly afterwards. Medics began CPR on her as she stopped breathing, and administered it to her on the way to the hospital. Sadly, she was pronounced dead 45 minutes after arrival.” Layne said the cause of the fire was undetermined. Kruger is survived by her wife Kelly. She had served for nine years as a firefighter. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said the City would offer the family a full brigade funeral as Kruger died while serving in the line of duty. “Kruger passed away in hospital yesterday after collapsing on the fire line on the lower slopes of Table Mountain. She received medical attention, but efforts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. "The cause of death has not yet been established. “On behalf of the City's Fire and Rescue Services, I extend my deepest condolences to Kruger’s family and friends.” Mayor Patricia de Lille also conveyed her condolences to the Kruger family, as did the DA . “The efforts of these brave men and women cannot be put into words. "These public servants provide a selfless service, for which we are eternally grateful,” DA MP Tertius Simmers said.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
