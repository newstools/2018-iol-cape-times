Police said that the man was arrested on December 28.  It is understood that rugby player was driving with a friend and the woman when an argument ensued.

The State indicated they would be ready to proceed with the bail application, even if profiles were still not ready by next week.  The defence made a request for a final remand.  The rugby player, who cannot be named until he has formally pleaded, appeared in the dock dressed in a checkered shirt and jeans.  He smiled at the public seated in a packed court gallery, to the annoyance of community members there to support the 18-year-old woman.  The case was postponed until January 15. Meanwhile, The Blue Bulls Company has issued a statement acknowledging the arrest, saying a further statement will be released “once the legal system has run its course”. African News Agency/ANA
