The Delft father was arrested after he allegedly choked and assaulted the infant before abandoning the baby along the R300 highway near Delft this week. Western Cape Missing Persons Unit chairperson Candice Soboker said the boy was receiving medical care at the Red Cross Children’s 
Hospital. “The baby is still in hospital and it is unclear at this stage when he will be discharged. "He is responding to his mother’s voice and held on to her finger when they visited him at hospital on Wednesday afternoon,” Sobotker said. She said her organisation had searched for the baby on Monday evening after police would not take a case of kidnapping from the baby’s mother, who wanted to report that the child had been snatched by the father. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed that the case was being investigated by the Delft SAPS.
