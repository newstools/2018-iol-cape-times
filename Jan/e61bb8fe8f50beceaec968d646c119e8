Carlo de Kock, the uncle of 10-year-old Charnelle, and Stanton Mano appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court yesterday for a bail hearing. Bail was denied to both accused. Magistrate Goolam Bawa read the State’s reasons for opposing bail when it was revealed De Kock’s wife would be a State witness. “The State opposes bail for the applicants due to the 
seriousness of the charges. Both applicants, the victim and the State witness are known to each other,” Bawa said. The State would also be revisiting two cases of sexual assault against De Kock, the magistrate added. “The accused (De Kock) has two previous convictions related to theft and drugs. He was also previously charged on two occasions for sexual assault on his own daughter. These cases were withdrawn and will now be revisited,” Bawa said. The court heard Charnelle was found wrapped in a curtain and plastic bag, and a forensic report stated she suffered 
multiple blunt-force injuries to her head, neck and genital areas. Traces of semen were found on her pants. Her body was found in a wetland in Manenberg on October 20 last year. Bawa said: “Looking at the brutality of the evidence, it is indeed a schedule six offence. I am satisfied that the State has shown the charges are serious. “It is barbaric and very prevalent in this jurisdiction. This requires severe sentencing should they be convicted of the crimes.” The State detailed that both accused were watching pornographic videos the day of Charnelle’s disappearance. The material has been seized by the police as part of the ongoing investigation. State prosecutor Shahieda Poole said two witness reports were outstanding, while digital footage and forensic reports were also pending. Both accused stated they would be pleading not guilty to the charges. The case was postponed until March 13.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
