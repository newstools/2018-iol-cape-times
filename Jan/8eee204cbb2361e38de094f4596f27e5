Mayco member for informal settlements Xanthea Limberg said the informal settlement was one of nine in the Strand area that would get electricity 
in a bid to curb illegal connections. Inganathi was electrocuted while playing in the alleys between shacks. He was declared dead shortly after he arrived at hospital on Thursday. Limberg said electrification of the nine settlements was planned over a two-year period, between December last year and December next year. She said Masakhane had been “scheduled for electrification around August 2019”. “The electrification of an informal settlement takes careful planning in light of several challenges,” she added. Community leader Mzwamadoda Fojisa said two years was a very long time and by that time “many would have lost their lives”. He said the number of people being killed should give the City reasons to 
prioritise the area. “We have made all the necessary efforts to show the City we deserve electricity. We even blocked the N2 to show our frustrations. "We don’t accept we will wait another two years,” said Fojisa. Last year, two cousins, Luniko, 5, and Lindani Madolo, 6, died after touching live wires at the Thabo Mbeki settlement in Philippi East. Limberg said: “As for the City’s independent investigation, the appointment has been finalised and it should proceed shortly."
