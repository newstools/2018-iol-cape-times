Since Louw died on New Year’s Eve, tributes have flooded social media, including his own. “The ANC joins South Africans in mourning the sad passing of comrade Mike Louw, activist, unionist, internationalist and a dedicated soldier for a better world,”wrote Jacobs. Cosatu national spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said the organisation worked with Louw for 21 years. “He was also an anti-apartheid activist, who spent his entire life for a South Africa that was free of oppression, injustice and exploitation. (At the time of his death) he was working in the federation’s provincial office responsible for organising and education,” Pamla said.  “He leaves behind his wife, children and grandchildren. We shall forever remain indebted to him for his contribution in championing the cause of justice and fighting the noble fight of freeing the working class from exploitation without fear or favour. “As Cosatu, we lower our banners in honour of this fallen cadre and we commit to continuing with the struggle for a world free of oppression and exploitation.  “He will be sorely missed by his family, colleagues and the entire mass democratic movement.” Social media messages included from Christine Olivier: “We're lost for words. You were a selfless, disciplined and caring leader. Metalworkers salute you for the sacrifices you made for workers. Always ready to serve.  “We’ll miss you cde Castro as you were known in Numsa (National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa).” Jan Kotze stated: “Take some time to believe that one of the finest worker leaders and organic union officials that I know of Numsa and Cosatu, cde Mike Louw, passed on today.  “He used to say ‘respect leaders, but never fear them’. All the best to his family during their time of grief and to the entire labour movement.”   chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
