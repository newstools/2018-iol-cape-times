Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said two men aged 22 and 48 were killed as they sat inside a car in Vlamboom Street. The double murder follows the shooting of two people on Saturday. One died and the other was injured. Last week, a man who was on his way home was also shot and killed in Firethorn Street. Ward councillor Angus McKenzie said the shootings appeared to be gang-related, except the double murder yesterday, as the people were not from the area. McKenzie said the two men in the car were waiting outside the house of a person they were supposed to give a lift to work. “Guys circled the car and opened fire, and the man who was supposed to get in the car ran back into the house.” McKenzie said there had been peace in the area for a while, but the recent shootings disrupted it. “This just catapults residents back into living in fear. They are on a constant roller-coaster.” McKenzie said last week he had escaped death after he was shot at the scene of a murder. Anyone with information may call Crime Stop on 08600 10111. Meanwhile, in the Athlone Magistrate's Court a 20-year-old is expected to appear on a charge of 
murder today. Rwexana said the suspect is alleged to have stabbed a 23-year-old man in Sweet Home Farms. The victim later died in hospital.
