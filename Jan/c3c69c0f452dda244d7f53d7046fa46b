It is now becoming a common tradition to lose our loved ones on the trains, while many are injured and can no longer look after their families. We wish a speedy recovery to all injured passengers who were involved in that shocking incident. Our prayers and thoughts are with them. The condition of our public locomotives has become so dire that neither politicians nor Transnet officials will commute in them.  Those in charge of Transnet, including Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, do not have confidence in these derelict trains.  These trains are used by the masses because they cannot afford decent transport on the peanuts they earn from their exploited labour. The train communication system is so poor that sometimes several trains share a single track, causing people to arrive at their workplaces late, many of them having been dismissed because of repeatedly arriving at work late.  This happens daily, but it only gets the attention of the media when lives are
lost.  Our trains are always overcrowded because of incompetent officials who sell more tickets than there are seats/standing room on the trains.  The state of Prasa is declining on a daily basis and we are not seeing
sufficient intervention to arrest the
situation.  Many of our state-owned enterprises are failing because they are regarded as ATMs by thugs who do not value the lives of their countrymen.  Kenneth Mokgatlhe PAC national spokesperson
