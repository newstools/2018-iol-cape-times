Bird was arrested on June 22 last year for the murder of Aniesa Bardien, 37, who disappeared from her Eastridge home on January 7, 2013.  Further to the murder charge, he faces four counts of rape that took place in 
2014 and 2016, a charge of intimidation and extortion also having taken place in 2016. It is alleged Bird lured his victims with a promise of a job.  Bardien’s decomposed body was found in a shallow grave at Strandfontein Beach three months after her 
disappearance.  Police investigation and DNA tests confirmed the body was that of Bardien.  Mitchells Plain Impact Association chairperson Joanie Fredericks said they were “taken aback but at the same time relieved” when Bird decided to abandon his bail application.  “Bird came to court with a backpack and cleanly shaven. He looked as if he was confident to get bail.  “But he shocked everyone after consulting with his lawyer and the court heard he would be abandoning his bail application,” she said.  Fredericks said the support shown by the community shows the courts they want justice to prevail.  Bird remains in custody at Pollsmoor Prison until his court appearance on February 19. The case was postponed for further investigation.
