Cape Town - Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille on Wednesday paid tribute to 33-year-old firefighter Ashley "Candice" Kruger who died in the line of duty at the weekend. During a council meeting on Wednesday, De Lille saluted Kruger who had been a firefighter for nine years.  Ashley "Candice" Kruger Kruger, who was stationed at the Roeland Street fire station in central Cape Town, died in hospital on Sunday after collapsing on the fire line on Table Mountain. "She received medical attention, but efforts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. This is indeed a great loss to the City and we salute Candice for the years of brave service to the City," De Lille said. De Lille extended her sympathy to Kruger's colleagues, friends and family. "The City will assist the Kruger family with funeral arrangements and will also offer trauma counselling to her relatives and platoon colleagues. The City’s Fire and Rescue Service will also offer the family a full brigade funeral as Candice died while serving in the line of duty," added De Lille. She also called for a moment of silence for jazz legend Hugh Masekela, former Cape Town Mayor Gerald Morkel, cancer fighter Junaid Arendse, former mayor of the Overstrand municipality Rudolph Smith, and renowned poet Keorapetse Kgosietsile. - African News Agency (ANA)
