The Overberg District Municipality Fire Department and Disaster Management were put on high alert last Friday and cordoned off a large part of Golf Street in Bredasdorp following the theft of a construction vehicle containing radioactive 
substances. Overberg Fire and Disaster Management chief Reinhard Geldenhuys said experts and technicians familiar with the machine were urgently flown from Stellenbosch to ensure that no radioactive substances were released from it. “A large part of Golf Street was cordoned off and the houses next to the wendy house were evacuated after the discovery was made. "The machine was used to take X-rays to determine soil density and was stolen at a construction company on Thursday night, and broken to be sold as scrap metal.” One part of the machine was brought to the fire department by police to ensure that it was not radioactive, said Geldenhuys, but another part found contained radioactive substances. He said officials could not jeopardise the lives of people and therefore called on the specialists to ensure that there was no danger to residents. Bredasdorp residents were grateful for the quick response by the Overberg emergency services, police and other role-players, said Geldenhuys. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk confirmed that the incident had occurred and said further enquiries must be directed to the directorate for priority crime 
investigation. Hawks spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha said its bomb-disposal unit and other officials were deployed to Bredasdorp after being informed of the theft of the radioactive substances. “Rodney Cleophas, 27, and Carl Brass, 42, were arrested and charged with the theft of the construction vehicle and appeared at the Bredasdorp Magistrate's Court. "The two radioactive capsules were retrieved from the property in Golf Street and no injuries related to the materials were reported.” Ramovha said the two suspects would remain in custody until their bail appearance on February 5.
