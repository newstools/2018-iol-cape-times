The 13-year-old, who attended the Eoan Dance Group, has been described as the “most deserving” by the principal, Abida Medel, after he was awarded the inaugural Christopher Kindo Dance Scholarship, a project of the Applauz Arts Initiative. He will attend the School of the Arts for his entire high school career. His first year of study in 2018 will be covered by the scholarship. Bestman described what lay in store for him as the “experience of a lifetime”. He said he was both scared and excited, but was settling in. “This will be the first time that I will be away from my family and friends for such a long time. But I know they support me and they encouraged me before I boarded my plane on Monday,” he said. Both his mother and grandmother were there to send off the young performer. This, he said, was an especially proud moment for him as his mother had often been forced to miss his dance recitals due to personal struggles. Creative director of Applauz Arts Initiative Natalia da Rocha said Bestman was all set for a new journey. “He will be one of several hundred creative energies that will be starting their high school journey. As a member of an art school, he will be introduced to more than just ballet and will not be the only one doing ballet, as was the case during primary school."
