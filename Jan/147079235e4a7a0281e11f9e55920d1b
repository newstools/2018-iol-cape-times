Inganathi Dywili was electrocuted about two weeks ago when he stepped on a metal sheet attached to an illegally connected live wire. He was rushed to hospital, where he was declared dead. At the service Inganathi’s pictures were hung around the walls of the Masakhane community hall and displayed on a big screen. The City of Cape Town’s failure to electrify Masakhane informal settlement, where tens of thousands of people live, took centre stage at the memorial service, with complaints that if the area had been electrified, Inganathi would still be alive. Mourners filed past his white and gold coffin. The family also pleaded for help with Inganathi’s funeral. Inganathi’s mother, Nonzwakazi Dywili, covered herself with a blanket as family members comforted her. Resident Akhona Sezile said they were sad to have lost Inganathi at a young age and under such circumstances. “This is not the first time that a person has been killed by an illegally connected electricity line. If the government does not electrify this area, many people, especially children who cannot distinguish what is safe and what is dangerous, will die,” said Sezile. “The municipality knows our plight and the danger we face because of illegal connections, but nothing has been done for years.” Community leader Mzwamadoda Fojisa said it was sad to say goodbye to a young life like that of Inganathi’s. “We were looking forward to seeing a leader in him but God had other plans for him. His life was taken away cruelly. He did not deserve to die like that.” Folisa said he would not stop residents from illegally electrifying their homes because “without it life would be miserable”. Inganathi’s father, Mbizo Nonceba, said: “The pain I go through every day is unbearable.”
