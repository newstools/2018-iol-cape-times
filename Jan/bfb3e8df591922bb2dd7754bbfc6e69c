Community leaders believe that the killings could have been a revenge attack by associates of a number of criminals who were arrested late last year and charged with the shooting of 11 people in the area. Marikana informal settlement had seen mass bloodshed in September when community members allegedly killed 12 suspected criminals over a month.  It is believed that the alleged criminals retaliated and killed community leaders towards the end of the year.  Police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk said the circumstances related to the death of a 29-year-old, whose identity is not known at this stage, and 33-year-old Filipus Nauyala, were under investigation.  He said the wounded men were taken to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.  “According to reports, they were shot by an unknown group of suspects who entered the shebeen and robbed patrons inside, and randomly shot at people.   "A double murder and attempted murder cases were registered for investigation,” said Van Wyk.  Community leader Melikhaya Laphi said concerns have been raised with police about escalating crime in the area.  “We have pleaded with the shebeens to close early, but that is still defied,” he said.
