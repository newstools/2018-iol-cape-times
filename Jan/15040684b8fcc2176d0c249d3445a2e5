I have been fortunate to work within the South African music industry and to have interacted on a personal 
level with Hugh and his manager, Josh Georgiou, on a 
number of occasions over the years. In 2011, when Sipho Mabuse was having a private get-together with his friends, Hugh was invited and I waited to greet him. I was nervous.Not out of fear, but out of having the utmost respect for the man. Hugh had an aura. He had a commanding presence, but when he spoke to you, you were the only person that mattered in the room. My daughter Casey was with me at the event at the time and I asked Hugh to take a picture with Casey, who was 11 years old. Hugh’s remark to me was: “Why me and your daughter, I am not famous." The memory is still so vivid in my mind as I reflect on the personal interactions with Hugh. Another fond memory I have was at the 2015 Cape Town International Jazz Festival and in the dining area sat Bra Hugh, Sipho Mabuse and film composer Trevor Jones. The interaction between these three great men was amazing to see. Each one telling stories about their mutual friends and laughing about the work they did. The ultimate accolade in my opinion was during that same 2015 jazz festival; to witness first hand how other artists from other bands would gravitate towards Bra Hugh for a picture or for a word. They all greeted the man with the utmost respect and listened to every word he said. Hugh could deal with the business of music in such a good way. Hugh’s aura would sometimes be mistaken for arrogance, but in all the dealings I had with him he was charming and respectful. As we reflect on the great man that is Hugh Masekela, let us also try to instil a culture of reading in all schools. Hugh’s autobiography, Still Grazing (2004), would be a good way to start. Rest in peace Bra Hugh, the pain is gone - soar with the angels. Myers is the founder and convener of Music Exchange, and personal manager to a number of local artists
