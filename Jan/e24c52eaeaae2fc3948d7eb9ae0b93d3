The victim was attacked by three men on Tuesday while walking to the beach.  During the violent attack, the victim was bashed over the head by the trio.  Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “A case of robbery with a weapon other than a firearm was opened.” Van Wyk said two 16-year-old males were arrested and would appear in Wynberg Magistrate's Court after they were interviewed by the 
probation officer.  “The SAPS suggests to the community members to walk in groups to prevent themselves from falling prey to crime,” Van Wyk said.  CPF spokesperson JJ Devellier said incidents of muggings had increased over the last three years.  “These are hot spots because they are secluded. From the car park at Sandy Bay to the dunes at Hout Bay and on Chapman’s Peak.” Devellier recommended avoiding the areas.  “Many of the muggings are drug-fuelled, the suspects are aggressive. So travel in large groups and do not carry valuables. In the event of an attack, do not resist,” he said. Cape Times
