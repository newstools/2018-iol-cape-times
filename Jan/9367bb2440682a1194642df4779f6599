A council meeting on Friday adopted the report and decided to investigate allegations of corruption allegedly committed by De Lille.  The law firm had been appointed to investigate whether any prima facie grounds existed for disciplinary action against one or more of the City of Cape Town's senior managers. De Lille said she will ask her lawyers “how to deal with this most unfortunate outcome of a process that was meant to provide a clear and independent way forward”. She said Bowman Gilfillan reserved the right to amend the report after she informed them of the “errors”. “And I requested that they amend the report, and some of their findings, based on the factual errors I pointed out,” she said. De Lille has submitted her reasons why she should not have to resign after the Democratic Alliance asked her to say why she should not be fired. This is the second investigation De Lille is facing from within her own party. Last year she was put on precautionary suspension for alleged maladministration. DA chairperson James Selfe could not be reached for comment.
