Jones appeared before the George Magistrate's Court  yesterday. He was arrested at his home in Pacaltsdorp in 2016, on the same day the DA informed him that a disciplinary hearing had found him guilty for his involvement in the housing scam and for bringing the party into disrepute. He and his co-accused, Eglowh Johnson, face charges of allegedly swindling several people, including a police captain, out of their cash. NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the case against Jones and Johnson had been postponed to February 7. “The case was postponed for the Legal Aid Board of South Africa to come on board for accused one (Jones). Accused two has a lawyer and both accused are facing 11 counts of fraud and theft relating to the selling of RDP houses,” he said. A  George ward councillor, Virgill Gericke, said: “We are happy with the case that the State has against these two men and the matter may soon be finalised. "The truth would soon come out and ultimately justice would be served for those people who came forward.” Johnson said he would not comment on the matter at this time and Jones could not be reached for comment by deadline.
