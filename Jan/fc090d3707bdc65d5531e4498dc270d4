Cape Town - While most Capetonians are in full panic mode over the #WaterCrisis and #DayZero, now set at April 12, the South African Twittersphere had a lot to say about "how normal what Cape Town is going through for many South Africans". Day Zero is when most of the city's taps will be shut off and residents will have to queue for their daily ration of 25 litres of water per day. But in a bid to stave off what seems inevitable, on February 1 the City of Cape Town will implement Level 6b water restrictions, where residents are encouraged to only use 50 litres of water a day. Social media has been flooded with tips on how to do this, but there were also tweets about how people in South Africa have been and currently are living without ready and easy access to water. Author and blogger Khaya Dlanga fired off "a little thread about water and how normal what Cape Town is going through for many South Africans".                      Dlanga's tweets struck a chord with many including @PelisaS.    Water warrior Western Cape Premier Helen Zille also sparked a conversation when she tweeted a picture of here washing in a "skottel".    Police Minister Fikile Mbalula responded with four words.    To which Zille responded: "Dear Mbaks. You are not the ONLY ONE who grew up washing e-Vaskomini! My mother used to scrub me like that too." Others also called out Zille saying this was nothing new.       IOL
