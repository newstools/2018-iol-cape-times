Accounting student Shiehaam Diedericks also faced threats that she would not graduate until her fees were paid in full. Her mother, Raydie Diedericks, approached the university’s ombud to lay a complaint. But she said this proved fruitless. Shiehaam has been studying at the institution for the last six years. Last year she did her postgraduate diploma in accounting and passed, and obtained a traineeship with an accounting firm.  Following yesterday’s story on Shiehaam’s difficulties in getting her results, a number of Cape Times readers offered to pay her fees so that she could graduate. One of them, Ander Barklöf, who had been rescued from the streets of Colombia and adopted by a Swedish couple, and had made it to Harvard Business School through hard work and was a director of a Nordic region investment bank, said: 
“I will pay for it.” Another reader, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “I would like to take this opportunity to settle the outstanding debt at UCT for you, Mrs Diedericks.” Jennifer Zuck said she was “appalled” when she read Shiehaam’s story.  “It’s so petty and ridiculous. If Mrs Diedericks is unable to obtain the money I will be happy to pay it for her daughter.”
