According to a statement from the Eden District municipality in Mooihoek, near Oudtshoorn, firefighters managed to protect a number of homes, a large storeroom and 12 wooden structures from being destroyed. Eden District Fire teams, assisted by Cape Nature, are doing mopping-up operations and protecting houses. Yesterday, a contractor team from Waterval, with 10 members, was brought in to assist. The municipality said a fire line creeping down the mountain from the south will be anchored above the Cape Nature fire break and diverted away from structures towards a recently burnt area within a 2km proximity. At the Habitat farm towards the Kouma River, a backburn of 2km was put in place from Saturday. Yesterday, crucial wetting and mop-up operations continued. Mopping up and patrolling of lines continued throughout the day at the Robinson Pass towards the Habitat farm. At the Geelhoutvlei plantations, mopping-up operations continued with 52 ground crew. With mist clearing and weather conditions getting warmer with a south/south-easterly wind blowing moderately, the municipality said: “Good fire-fighting efforts and favourable weather will ensure securing of all lines in this period.” Working on Fire spokesperson Lauren Howard said teams were active in Albertinia and Ruitersbos. “They are doing mop-up operations and securing the fire lines, so whatever active fire line is still ongoing, their mission for today is to contain them and mitigate smoke as well,” Howard said.
