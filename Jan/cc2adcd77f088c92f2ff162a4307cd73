She ended up in hospital with a fractured ankle and a swollen back. Heathfield resident Merle Philander, 59, was travelling home from the CBD when she heard a commotion from one of the coaches on Wednesday. She said men armed with knives had robbed commuters on the train. On Saturday, a 19-year-old from Sharedon Park, Steenberg, died after jumping from a fast-moving train while 
trying to escape robbers between Lakeside and False Bay stations. When Philander jumped, the train had stopped between Southfield and Heathfield stations. “I heard in the other carriage people screaming and I could see a man carrying a knife. The man was snatching people’s bags.” Before she knew it, the assailants were in her carriage  and she decided to jump out of the train. She landed on her back, fractured her ankle and lost consciousness. Philander has not yet opened a case as she is unable to move from her bed. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said: “Please encourage her to report the incident to SAPS. Our claims office can assist.”
