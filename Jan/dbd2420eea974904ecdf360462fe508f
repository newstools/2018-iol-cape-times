Nyanga CPF spokesperson Martin Makasi said:  “We are happy that police are cracking down on domestic violence issues as well. “It is encouraging to see that police are not spectators of gender-based violence. “Men are trying to use their power over women and children to perpetrate crimes and we 
are glad police are making arrests in this regard. “Perpetrators must know that even if they run away the police will track them 
down. We are glad the community is also standing up against these criminals by reporting the crimes.” This comes after police said two men are expected to make a court appearance in the 
Athlone Magistrate’s Court today. One faces a charge of murder and the other a charge of rape. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “We are aware of a series of arrests that have been made over the past few weeks. “There were cluster operations and drug houses were targeted. “This is very encouraging, as we can see police operations are reducing crime in the area. “The two suspects were arrested on January 25 in Samora Machel and Sweet Home Farms.” Rwexana said the 53-year-old suspect had allegedly sexually assaulted his daughter while her mother was busy in the house. The alleged incident happened last week. “The suspect told the victim not to tell her mother, but the girl ultimately informed someone close to her.” The 20-year-old suspect, who faces a murder charge, was arrested for allegedly stabbing a 23-year-old man in December. The victim died.  chevon.booysen@inl.co.za
