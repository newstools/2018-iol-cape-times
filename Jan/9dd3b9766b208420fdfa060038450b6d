The Animal Welfare Society of South Africa, based in Philippi, has been around for more than 89 years, but a growing number of animals are arriving at the clinic despite a reduction in the water needed to service them. A nurse at the Animal Welfare Society of SA, Jaque le Roux, said they had more than 200 animals and each one needed at least 1 litre of water a day. “Animals are important to humans and they should not be forgotten, especially when the government passes out water rules because animals cannot go and find water for themselves. We are their voices,” he said. Le Roux said the response by water donors had been underwhelming, although they had drop-off points in Kenilworth, Ottery, Pinelands, Edgemead/Bothasig, Diep River and Philippi. Water For Paws, a campaign to raise awareness for donations towards animal shelters, said they would need help from donors. To donate, contact Barron from Water for Paws at
